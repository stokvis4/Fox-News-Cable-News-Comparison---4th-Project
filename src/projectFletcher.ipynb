    "# Comparing Cable News Hosts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore the commentary of the hosts for each of the three main cable news networks using unsupervised learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shows\n",
    "Fox News:\n",
    "   * Tucker Carlson Tonight\n",
    "   * Hannity\n",
    "   \n",
    "CNN:\n",
    "   * Erin Burnett Outfront\n",
    "   * Anderson Cooper 360\n",
    "    \n",
    "MSNBC:\n",
    "   * All In with Chris Hayes\n",
    "   * The Rachel Maddow Show\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources:\n",
    "I used a combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape the transcripts. For CNN and MSNBC, I pulled from their respective websites. For Fox News, I used Fox News's website to pull Hannity and used Archive.org's transcipts to pull Tucker Carlson Tonight. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date Range:\n",
    "I pulled data from the beginning of 2016 but the majority of my analysis comes from the beginning of 2017 onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Fox News's success is due to many factors. Fox News exploits behavioral economic biases to beat the competition consistently. Three of the noticeable ones that I explore in this notebook are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Emotion** - Fox News hosts make a noticeably higher amount of statements that are emotional. Using the VADER Sentiment tool, I plotted positive and negative statements by each host for each transcript. Fox News consistently appears to have a higher level of negative statements compared to the other networks. By stoking negative emotions in their audiences, they exploit the negativity bias of their audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Catchphrases** -  Just as Trump created memorable catchphrases for his campaign rivals (we all remember \"Low Energy Jeb\" and \"Crooked Hillary\"), Fox News hosts have memorable catchphrases that their audiences can grab onto and remember. Using ngram analysis, I was able to derive common phrases for each host. While MSNBC and CNN hosts refer to newspapers (like \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"New York Times\") and generic statements (like \"We'll be right back\"), Fox News hosts have memorable lines. For Hannity, he coined the phrase \"Destroy Trump media\" to refer mainstream media sources. For Tucker Carlson, the combination of the phrase \"the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink\" appeared multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create an Enemy** -  Fox News hosts have successfully created multiple enemies that allow them to frame an issue they bring up. Using NMF  topic modeling, I was able to compare the topics that the hosts focused on. For Hannity, he has created an enemy by tying Hillary Clinton to multiple issues, including the Steele Dossier, Special Counsel invesitigation, and the most surprising, the #MeToo movement. Additionally, he's created an enemy in the media which is the topic of one grouping and mentioned in another. By associating Hillary Clinton with multiple topics, he is able to frame issues in his audience's heads by exploiting the availability heuristic.\n",

      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 22, 2016 Guest: Lindsey Smith, Linda Lee ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining with us this hour. Happy weekend. Happy Friday. OK, this goes in an unexpected place but trust me, you`re going to enjoy the ride. In May 2008, John McCain had all but wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. At that point, it was basically just a march to the convention for him. But sometimes candidates hit obstacles in their campaigns that weren`t put there by their opponents. It`s not because one of their rivals for the nomination or a candidate from another party has hit them with something particularly hard. Sometimes, candidates just make their own unforced errors. And John McCain did that in the spring of 2008 when he momentarily hopped into bed with a sort of high-profile guy who it turned out had very, very strong and strongly stated beliefs about among other things the Catholic Church. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HAGEE, TEXAS PASTOR: This is the great whore of Revelations 17. This is the antichrist system. This is the apostate church. God says the day is going to come when I`m going to cause this beast to devour this apostate system. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That man`s name is John Hagee, a Texas pastor who preaches that the Catholic Church is the whore of Babylon that will be devoured by the antichrist. He also claimed that the great whore, aka the Catholic Church, drinks the blood of the Jewish people. John Hagee in the spring of 2008 endorsed Senator John McCain for president. And John McCain initially was psyched. He appeared with Pastor Hagee to accept his endorsement in person. He thanked him in person for the endorsement. He basically campaigned on that endorsement. But if the Catholic Church being the whore of Babylon wasn`t enough to sour that blossoming political alliance, eventually this part of John Hagee`s public life made the whole thing slightly untenable for Senator McCain. Do we have this clip from John Hagee? Oh, I think we`ll have it in just a second. This is – well, OK. Go ahead. Go for it. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAGEE: God sent a hunter. A hunter is someone who comes with a gun. And he forces you. Hitler was a hunter. How did it happen? Because God allowed it to happen. Why did it happen? Because God said my top priority for the Jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' God sent Hitler. God sent Hitler. Well, John McCain could apparently endure some of the other things that Pastor John Hagee was known to have said about the Catholic Church and other topics. Pastor Hagee, for example, also blamed Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans having once hosted a gay pride parade. God sent the hurricane to New Orleans to punish them for gay people existing in public in that city. But when John Hagee said that the Nazis were doing God`s work, that Hitler was sent by God to kill the Jews, that was kind of a harder sell. And so, in May of 2008 John McCain, having accepted the endorsement and campaigned on the endorsement from John Hagee, he had to retroactively reject John Hagee`s endorsement and endure a few days worth of headlines like these, “McCain rejects Hagee backing as not (INAUDIBLE)” So, that was one bump on the road to John McCain being nominated as the Republican Party`s candidate in 2008. And honestly, you know what, candidates cannot be held responsible for everything said and done and believed by people who like them and endorse them and vote for them, right? But that`s why the Hagee debacle was such an unforced error on the part of John McCain. It would be one thing if John Hagee had just endorsed John McCain and John McCain had nothing to do with him, then he wouldn`t be responsible for vetting Pastor John Hagee and make sure that he didn`t, for example, think Hitler was doing God`s work. John McCain`s screw-up in 2008 was that he overtly welcomed the endorsement. And appeared with the guy and campaigned on the endorsement. And once you do that, you kind of own it, which somebody should explain sometime very soon to Texas Senator Ted Cruz. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MIKE BICKLKE, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PRAYER FOUNDER: Let me tell you, these 20 – less than 20 million Jews worldwide. God is going to bring them all back. The Lord says I`m going to offer two strategies to Israel, to these 20 million. He says, first I`m going to offer them grace. I`m going to send the fisherman. Do you know how a fisherman lures? I mean, do you know how a fisherman does their thing? They have the bait in front, luring the fish. It`s a picture of grace. The hunters are opposite. Instead of luring them in front, hunters drive with fear from behind. The Lord says, I`m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fisherman. I`m going to give them grace. I`m going to give them grace. And he says that if they don`t respond to grace, I`m going to raise up the hunters. And the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolf Hitler. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here we are again. God sent Hitler to chase the Jews. Now, that is not the guy who famously had to be renounced by John McCain in 2008. That wasn`t John Hagee who you just heard there. That`s a different guy. His name is Mike Bickle. And the Ted Cruz campaign just put out an excited statement proclaiming the Ted Cruz endorsement from Pastor Mike Bickle. Look, presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced the endorsement of Mike Bickle, founder and director of the International House of Prayer of Kansas City. Quote, “Heidi and I,” this is in Ted Cruz`s voice, “Heidi, my wife and I are grateful to have Mike`s prayers and supports. With the support of Mike and many people of faith, we will fight the good fight, finish the course, and keep the faith.” Part of what Mike Bickle teaches at his version of IHOP, the international house of not pancakes but prayer, is that God sent Hitler to chase the Jews, the Nazis were doing God`s work. Mike Bickle also famously says he can see in the United States today harbingers of the antichrist. Things that tell you the antichrist is coming. And you`d never believe who he thinks is the most nefarious one. Spoiler alert: It`s not President Obama. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: The harlot of Babylon is preparing the nations to receive the antichrist. The harlot of Babylon will be the religion of affirmation, toleration, no absolutes, a counterfeit justice movement. They will be sincere, many of them, but their sincerity will not in any way lessen the impact of their deception. The fact that they are sincere does not make their deception less damaging. I believe that one of the main pastors as a forerunner to the harlot movement, it`s not a movement yet, is Oprah. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Who? Oprah. Oprah Winfrey, harbinger of the antichrist. Seems unlikely, right? But that`s the whole point. Seems so unlikely. That`s how she does it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: Oprah. She is winsome. She is kind. She is reasonable. She is utterly deceived. Utterly deceived. A classy woman. A cool woman. A charming woman. But has a spirit of deception. And she`s one of the clear pastors, forerunners to the harlot movement. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That is who just gave a presidential endorsement to Ted Cruz. And that is the guy who Ted Cruz put out the official campaign statement proclaiming the endorsement thanking Pastor Mike Bickle for the endorsement. Ted Cruz is now campaigning on his support from this guy who says that Oprah is the harbinger of the antichrist, first reported by people for the American Way. And it will be interesting to see if the Republican Party has changed enough since 2008, right? Even though John McCain couldn`t endure holding on to this endorsement in 2008 from a guy who said that God sent Hitler to come hunt the Jews. That was not sustainable in Republican Party politics in 2008. It will be interesting to see if eight years later in 2016, Ted Cruz can stand to proclaim and welcome and be proud of the endorsement of a guy who said the exact same thing, that God sent Hitler to hunt the Jews, it was God`s will. That will be interesting to watch. Even just over this weekend. To see if Ted Cruz has to walk back his excited statement of support from the guy who says that Hitler was God`s Jew hunter. Whether or not that happens, though, this endorsement from Mike Bickle of Ted Cruz and his proclaiming of it, it also offers an interesting new angle on the fast escalating fight between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump on the campaign trail because it turns out one weird front of battle between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump is Oprah Winfrey. And you think I`m kidding, I know. But I`m not, because it`s very clear. Here`s Ted Cruz`s guy whose endorsement Ted Cruz is now campaigning on. Here`s what he thinks about Oprah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: One of the main pastors as a forerunner to the harlot movement. It`s not the harlot movement yet. It`s Oprah. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oprah. How you know the antichrist is on his way. That`s Ted Cruz`s guy. That`s how Oprah functions in the Ted Cruz for president campaign. Here is how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign. Here`s how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT LAUER, TODAY SHOW: Running mate. If you decide to go with this, who would be the ideal running mate for Donald Trump? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, I think Oprah would be great. LAUER: Seriously. TRUMP: I think that – probably that would be serious, actually. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That was Donald Trump the first time he flirted with running for president in the 2000 presidential campaign. He volunteered apropos of nothing that he was considering Oprah Winfrey to be his vice presidential running mate that year if he in fact mounted a bid for the presidency which he didn`t. That was the only name he ever floated as a possible vice president in the 2000 campaign. That wasn`t like people were asking him, “Hey, everybody likes Oprah, you`re friendly with Oprah, shouldn`t Oprah be your running mate?” No, he just brought it up. Vice president Oprah. That was a long time ago. That would have been the presidential campaign in the year 2000. But apparently, he is still thinking along those lines this time around. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Back in 1999 when you were thinking as the reform party candidate you told Larry King that you`d consider Oprah for vice president. TRUMP: I like Oprah. What can I tell you? INTERVIEWER: Still on your short list? TRUMP: She`s great. She`s talented. She`s a friend of mine. She`s a good person. I`ve been on her show. In fact I was on her show the last week. She said, could I be on her show with the whole family. I like Oprah. Is that supposed to be a bad thing? INTERVIEWER: No. The kind of people you`re going to run – TRUMP: Oprah would be great. I`d like to have Oprah. I think we`d win easily actually. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' In what is turning out to be kind of a Donald Trump-Ted Cruz death match at this stage in the 2016 presidential race one of the fronts of battle turns out to be Oprah Winfrey. It`s a pretty clear distinction, right? Harbinger of the antichrist or possible running mate. Choose. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump today also both broke new ground in their campaigns by unveiling straight up attack ads against each other. In terms of my assessment of these ads, I think they`re both about the same caliber, same quality, will have the same effect. I will say the anti-Trump ad by Ted Cruz does have one laugh out loud moment that I think you`re not supposed to laugh at. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) TRUMP: I`m Donald Trump, and I approve this message. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: It sounded like you wanted the bill to pass. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course, I wanted the bill to pass – my amendment to pass. What my amendment did – BAIER: You said the bill. CRUZ: – is take citizenship off the table. But it doesn`t mean – what it doesn`t mean that I supported the other aspects of the bill. I want immigration reform to pass. And it allows those who are here illegally to come in out of the shadows. BAIER: The amendment would have allowed undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. permanently and obtain legal status. So, how do you square this circle? CRUZ: Actually, Bret, it wouldn`t have. TRUMP: People want to take back their country. We want to do it in a humane way, but we have to have a country. We don`t have a country right now. We have people pouring in. They`re pouring in. And they`re doing tremendous damage. If you look at the crime, if you look at the economy, we want to have borders. To have a country you have to have borders. We don`t have borders right now. AD NARRATOR: Eminent domain – fancy term for politicians seizing private property to enrich the fat cats who bankroll them. Like Trump. TRUMP: I think eminent domain is wonderful. AD NARRATOR: It made him rich. Like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn`t have a heart. AD NARRATOR: Trump won`t change the system. He`s what`s wrong with it. CRUZ: I`m Ted Cruz, and I approve this message. (END VIDEO CLIPS) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both unveiling direct old school nasty style attack ads against each other today, ten days out from the Iowa caucuses. Neither of these candidates has spent very much money at all on advertisements thus far. They are both sitting on basically infinite funds. So, if Ted Cruz and Donald Trump decide to spend all of their infinite funds, throwing stuff like that at each other, the people of Iowa over these next ten days are going to be treating their TVs like a hazmat site, like not only are people not going to watch TV anymore, they`re going to throw blankets over their TVs just in case they wake themselves up and accidentally start showing that stuff and scaring the kids. Tonight, just as we were going to art FOX News Channel released their latest poll in the Republican presidential race. This is a national poll of Republican voters. What it shows is a very clear stratifying of the race. So, just look. This is a pretty good snapshot actually for this time of year. We`ll start at the bottom. At 1 percent, you`ve got Jim Gilmore and Carly Fiorina. Remember when Carly Fiorina was going to be a contender? Yes. At 2 percent, that`s Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, utterly unsustainable for those candidates. Rand Paul`s dad even did an interview with a conservative website this week in which he told the interviewer he`s pretty sure Donald Trump is going to beat his son and win the nomination. That could not have helped, dear old dad. Dad! That said, Ron Paul is expected to be out on the campaign trail with his Mr. 2 Percent Son. It will be Ron campaigning with Rand for the first time this year, first time this season. They`ll start this weekend. Up at 3 percent, it`s Chris Christie who just left the campaign trail in New Hampshire this afternoon to head back to New Jersey in the face of the oncoming blizzard. Tied for 4 percent nationwide it is John Kasich and Jeb Bush. The main difference between these two candidates right now is John Kasich has spent a total of about $11 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls and Jeb Bush has spent $59 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls. Unless Jeb Bush somehow pulls this out miraculously, he is going to be one of the most spectacularly expensive political failures of all time. So, that`s the lowest tier of candidates right now in national polling, according to this new FOX News polling that`s out tonight. Second tier has two candidates in it. Ben Carson is at 8 percent which is still low, but it`s double Jeb Bush. Marco Rubio is also in the second tier. He`s at 11 percent. On top of them, it`s the clear top tier of the Republican race indisputably now. Donald Trump is still way out ahead. He`s definitely the front- runner. He`s got 34 percent of the vote. The only guy up there with him at all anywhere near him is Ted Cruz with 20 percent. And so, it`s really starting to look like the race for the Republican nomination is a race between Donald Trump and just Ted Cruz. And frankly, if it comes down to that, I think we should let Oprah pick. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What are you doing Wednesday night? If you don`t have plans already, don`t make them. If you do have plans for Wednesday night already, how firm are they? We`ve got an announcement coming up in just a moment. We`re doing something on this show on Wednesday night. It`s something we have never done before. It`s kind of a big deal for us. That announcement is straight ahead. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the federal government, the EPA, has now issued an 18-page emergency order to the state of Michigan and it`s pretty stern and it`s pretty dire. Quote, “EPA does not have information that would provide any assurance that contamination in Flint`s water system has been controlled.” And then in this order, they order the Rick Snyder administration to get on it, fast. They give the state of Michigan a series of really short deadlines. Within five days, the Snyder administration has to create a website where it has to post all its water testing results, all its testing plans, all its weekly status reports. Within ten days, the Snyder administration has to finally answer all the questions it never answered the last time the EPA asked the state for information about the lead in Flint`s water, which was back in November. And if you`re wondering how many questions the EPA had back then, yes. Look. It was a lot. And the Snyder administration has not been able to answer those questions for two months. Now, they`re under an emergency order that they`ve got to produce those answers in ten days. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to submit water quality measurements from Flint including ph, alkalinity, orthophosphates, chloride, turbidity, iron, calcium, temperature conductivity – they have to measure all of those things at ten sites every week and hand over the results. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to hand in all their lead testing results for Flint from the past three years. And within three days, the Snyder administration has to give the EPA a list of the zip codes in Flint where the highest blood levels have been found. It`s going to be a busy few days responding to this, right? Oh, but wait, there`s more. Because also in that ten-day window the Snyder administration is now ordered to hand over an inventory of homes in Flint, houses in Flint that are connected to the city water lines with service lines that are made out of lead. And they need to hand over that lead pipe inventory in a very specific way. They have to hand it over, quote, “in Excel spreadsheet or a similar format.” And I know you might be thinking, OK, so Michigan has to hand over a lot of data to the EPA, it`s not that big a deal, they can just send over their spreadsheets with all of that information. Here`s the thing, though – consider just one of the things the EPA is asking for, this spreadsheet. Excel or similar, right? A spreadsheet listing all of the homes in Flint that get their water through lead service lines. It`s important to know where they lead service lines are because then you know where you most need to test the water for lead, and you have to know it because those are the lines that are going to have to be dug up and replaced now that the untreated Flint River water has corroded them so badly that they will constantly leach lead into the water no matter how clean the water is that`s getting pumped through them. These again are the service lines that connect people`s houses to the water mains in the street. Back in November when the state finally started taking Flint`s lead poisoning crisis seriously, the state asked the city of Flint for this information. Where are all the lead service lines in the city? The city could not answer that question back in November. And when the folks at Michigan radio went to the Flint records office themselves to try to get the information themselves, they found out why the city couldn`t answer. And it`s amazing. Because it turns out these are Flint`s records of its water lines – filing cabinets full of disorganized handwritten index cards from the last 100 years along with a couple of old torn-up maps, more than 40,000 handwritten index cards. This is it. Flint has been in the process of trying to organize these records with the help of the University of Michigan, but you can see why if the EPA said we need a spreadsheet with all your lead service lines on it, we need it within 10 days, you can see why that might be a problem. And we`re now finding out this evening that might not be the only problem – at least according to the Snyder administration. The EPA did tell us tonight that Michigan has stated that it is committed to complying with this order, it is committed to implementing these measures, these things the EPA is asking for, but we have now also learned that the head of Michigan`s environmental agency has written to the EPA to say that the state, the Snyder administration, is questioning the legality of this federal order, questioning whether the EPA has the authority to order the state to take all these steps. Two sides are promising to try to talk this out, but right now, it looks like this could turn into a standoff between Michigan and the EPA, which is just what Flint needs. Hold that thought. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, yesterday, the EPA, the federal government sent the Rick Snyder administration in Michigan an 18-page emergency order giving the state a list of things they have to do very quickly to start addressing the lead poisoning crisis in Flint. As we just mentioned, we have learned tonight that the Snyder administration is challenging the legality of that order from the federal government. One of the things the state is being ordered to do by the federal government is hand over a spreadsheet listing lead pipe service lines in the city of Flint. Michigan radio was first to report that – do we have this picture? That this is the existing data information system in Flint for where those lead pipes are. It`s tens of thousands of handwritten index cards. Joining us now is Lindsey Smith. She`s reporter for Michigan Radio. She and her colleagues there have been doing great work on this story. Lindsey, it`s really nice to have you here. Your reporting really has been indispensable. LINDSEY SMITH, MICHIGAN RADIO REPORTER: My pleasure. ', 'MADDOW:', ' What do you make of this letter we`re just learn about from the head of the state environmental agency saying we`ve spent all this money, we`ve done what you asked, and we don`t think you have the legal authority to order us to do anything. Is that just the expected response when something like this happens? SMITH: I – you know, I think the letter said there are some facts and omissions that the EPA they`re saying is maybe not clear about in their response that they have done so far. I think the thing to note is the state has really in the last two weeks changed some major direction in how they`ve tried to handle this crisis, bringing in the National Guard, bringing in the state police, switching from just having water distribution sites to going door to door. So, I assume they will try to make the case that they have been trying to do everything they can to adequately protect public health, which is what the EPA`s order, this emergency order, says that they have not been able to do so far. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In terms of what the EPA is asking for or telling the Snyder administration they need to do, from what you`ve reported about how information is managed in Flint and what`s known about the systems there, thinking specifically about this deadline where they have to tell them where all the lead service lines are in all of the – for all of the homes in Flint, does it seem conceivable to you that the state could get that information together in electronic spreadsheet form within ten days? SMITH: They – I know they`re working on it. I`ll give you that. We really – I think this came to light in the course of this crisis because you do have to test for homes with lead service lines, at least 50 percent of your sampling pool is supposed to be from these homes because those are really the worst case scenario. That`s where the lead is going to show up first if you`re not treating the water properly, which is what happened in Flint. And when we realized that the records weren`t really in good order, we approached the state with that information, myself and other reporters, and said, you know, you dropped these two high lead samples for technical reasons, but you didn`t really look at the overall sample pool to make sure that the city of Flint was getting samples that they were supposed to from houses with lead service lines. And they – it was very shortly after some of those reports started coming out that the state sent the letter to Flint that you mentioned earlier saying, hey, you need to give us this information. Even before then the University of Michigan`s Flint campus had announced that they would be working with the city of Flint to try to make an electronic database as best they could. But talking to water officials in Flint, a lot of that is in their – a lot of the records or a lot of the things they know about the water system and not everything. I`m not trying to over-exaggerate this. But the guy told me a lot of this is in my memory, it`s in my head. We`ve worked here for a long time, so we know these things. So, they`re going to have to take these different databases they have, the index cards, the maps, and arguably what`s in the guys` heads and try to come up with a way to map the city as best they can. In November, they wanted to get that done by early February was the earliest they had told us they were going to be able to get that done. But I think once the state stepped in and said you need to get this to us there was a pedal to the metal push. So, I don`t know if they`re going to be able to pull it off or not. I think that`s some of the things we`re asking right now. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And the federal government pressure certainly is going to add to the pressure. But it remains to be seen what their capacity is. Lindsey Smith, reporter for Michigan Radio, really appreciate your time tonight in helping us with this story. And again, Michigan Radio has done seminal work on this story so far. It`s been indispensable for us trying to follow it at the national level. So, thank you. SMITH: My pleasure. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Thank you. I should also tell you, if we can go back there for a second. Thank you very much. I should also tell you that Michigan Radio`s documentary on this disaster in Flint is going to be airing on public radio stations across the country this weekend. You should check your public radio station listings for this. The documentary is called “Not Safe to Drink.” Again, check your local listings. They`re really, really good on this story. You owe it to yourself to hear this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' For the first seven-plus years that I had this show I could not get a Clinton on this show to save my life. I asked in the context of the 2008 campaign. I asked in the context of Hillary Clinton`s time as secretary of state. I asked in the context of her stepping down as secretary of state. I asked in a whole bunch of circumstances for an interview with former President Bill Clinton. I said I would travel, I said I would pretape, I`d do it live, anything. No dice. No Clintons for more than seven years. But then, tick, tick, tick, tick, ding. Something happened. A bell went off somewhere that allowed the circumstance to change. And now, during this presidential campaign over the last few weeks, I have had several opportunities to interview Secretary Clinton, which has been super helpful for our ability to cover this race. It`s been great. But in the first interview that I had with Secretary Clinton we had never met before after seven years of me asking for an interview. There was one question in that first interview that led to a little flurry of right-wing criticism at the time. And now today that issue is back. But in a very unexpected way. Here was the exchange I`m talking about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One policy question that I think the Republicans are raising, they`re talking about amongst themselves – hasn`t really burst into a general election conversation yet, but I`m genuinely shocked by it. Which is it`s becoming sort of fashionable in Republican circles to talk about abolishing the V.A., privatizing the V.A., getting rid of it. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Throwing veterans onto the mercies of the for profit health care system. The reason they`re able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the V.A. seem so intractable. If I had been running a Republican campaign against President Obama last year, I would have run it entirely on the V.A. A bureaucracy, a bloated big government program that can`t be fixed and let`s do right by our veterans. CLINTON: Mm-hmm. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you – do you have any new ideas for trying to fix it? You can`t find a person in politics who doesn`t say we shouldn`t do right by our veterans. But for some reason, this can`t get fixed fast enough. CLINTON: Yes. And I don`t understand that. You know, I don`t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans. And overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Much more so than people in the regular system. CLINTON: That`s exactly right. No one would believe that from the coverage you see and the constant berating of the V.A. that comes from Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, in part because there has been real scandal. CLINTON: There has been. But it`s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It has not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. Secretary Clinton went on to say that the V.A. needed to be reformed, she had specific things that she wanted to see changed to improve the V.A. But that comment, that part of her response about how widespread the problems were, that turned into like red alert, all caps, get out your fax machine hysteria on the right for about five minutes. Republicans professed to be very upset with that specific way that she characterized the problems at the V.A. despite everything else she said. Clearly, they said she was underplaying the terribleness of the V.A., she was apologizing for the V.A. when they implied the only right thing to say about the V.A. is that it should be condemned wholesale. And that little revolt on the right after that interview, that turned out to be a really instructive moment because there has been something quietly brewing on the right in the Republican Party, mostly under the radar but it bubbled up in that moment with Hillary Clinton in that interview, and it is coming up again right now for a completely backwards, opposite reason. And that story`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One of the weird things about presidential politics this year is that almost to a person, the entire Republican presidential field this year is totally on board with abolishing the V.A., getting rid of the V.A. or at least privatizing huge swaths of it, telling veterans they`re not going to be provided medical care anymore, they can go get it themselves. So, when veterans get off the plane and come home from war, just set them loose into the private health insurance market to fend for themselves. Thanks for your service, good luck with that, here`s a coupon. This used to be a very radical idea. When Mitt Romney dipped his toe into the “privatize the V.A.” pool back in 2012, he got it chomped off so fast that he abandoned the idea immediately and basically never spoke of it again. But this year hasn`t been that long, only four years later, and this year almost the entire Republican field is in favor of abolishing or privatizing the V.A. in some way. And that didn`t just happen overnight, even though it happened fast. Candidates this year were led in that direction, in part by this group. This is a group called Concerned Veterans for America, a fairly new conservative veterans group. They have been quietly courting the Republican presidential candidates over the past year, and singing to them the virtues of getting rid of the V.A. They`ve held a series of town hall events with this year`s presidential candidates in the early primary states and one by one, the Republican candidates have dutifully said that, yes, they see the light, they too want to radically change the way veterans in this country get their care, in some cases to turn veterans over to the private health insurance market even though veterans themselves say they very much do not want that. Concerned Veterans for America has been led for a long time by this guy, seen here in his other job as a FOX News Channel host. Naturally. His name is Pete Hegseth. He`s a veteran himself. And about a year and a half ago, Mr. Hegseth let out a little secret about Concerned Veterans for America. He kind of spilled the beans on a thing that had long been suspected but was never actually verified until he said it out-loud. Which is that this ostensibly grassroots veterans group, this group that has been single-mindedly focused on trying to kill the V.A., turns out they`re not so grassrootsy after all. In fact, the “kill the V.A.” conservative veterans group didn`t arise organically out of the veterans community. It was a deliberate creation of the billionaire conservative activist brothers Charles and David Koch. And the reason we know that the Koch brothers donor network supposedly created the grassroots veterans group is because the head of that group, Pete Hegseth himself, admitted it while speaking at a Koch donor conference about a year and a half ago. This is audio of those remarks. It was obtained by an online outfit called “The Undercurrent”, was published by “The Nation”, although MSNBC has not independently verified it. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, CONCERNED VETERANS FOR AMERICA: Concerned Veterans for America is an organization this network literally created. Now, unless you`ve been living under a rock for the last couple of months, you know about the crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs. What you probably don`t know is the central role that Concerned Veterans for America played in exposing and driving this crisis from the very beginning. I thank Charles and David, Marc Short, Kevin Gentry, everyone that puts in the sweat equity that makes this possible. And I want to thank you for your courage for standing up and being here. KEVIN GENTRY, VICE PRESIDENT, CHARLES KOCH FOUNDATION: Concerned Vets is something that came out of this network, and you all as investors are the ones who made this happen. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That is reportedly the Koch brothers guy at the end there saying, “You all as Koch network investors, you all are the ones who made this group happened, you created Concerned Veterans.” We reached out to the Koch donor network to see if they could tell us how much they have given this group and if they share this policy goal of killing the V.A. We haven`t yet heard back. But it`s kind of one of the sleeper issues of this campaign, that the Republican candidates have basically been captured by this Koch brothers- created, this Koch brothers-funded movement to kill the Veterans Administration. And now, in the midst of that effort with Iowa a week from Monday, with just a few months to go before the general election when presumably this issue is going to pop like you can`t believe it in the general election. I mean, imagine the fights about this at the general election debates. Right when all this kill the V.A. Koch brothers-funded organizing is about to blow up as an issue, the guy who has led that group, the guy who`s been at the forefront of this abolish the va movement since it started, he has just all of a sudden poofed. He`s just disappeared. He quit. He is no longer the head of Concerned Veterans for America, and nobody seems to know why. Hmm. Officially both sides are saying this was a mutual decision, we reached out to Concerned Veterans this week, they declined to provide any more details about what happened. Pete Hegseth told us himself he left over a, quote, “difference of opinion over the future of the organization.” And that`s basically all he would say. But regardless of the circumstances of his departure, what happens now? Because this is weird, right? This one group has been the driving force behind all of these Republican candidates getting on board with this incredibly radical idea of killing the V.A., making veterans fend for themselves in the private health insurance market to get their coverage, which brings a huge, totally hot button issue into the general election because, obviously, no Democratic candidate is going to stand for that and almost all of the Republicans want to do it. But now, the group that has turned this radical idea into mainstream Republican policy, they appear to be in the midst of maybe melting down themselves. This policy position on privatizing the V.A. or getting rid of it is now basically part of the Republican Party platform. It`s conservative orthodoxy now that the V.A. has to be burned to the ground and never rebuilt, good luck, vets. And if you disagree with that you have to be called out as a V.A. apologist. It was this Koch brothers-created group that helped push the Republican Party to that radical position. Now, their top guy has poofed right at the start of the election with no explanation whatsoever. So, what happens next here? And does that mean that the most radical plan to deal with veterans` issues in our country that we have seen in generations poofs with him? Watch this space. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I mentioned earlier that there was a big announcement coming. Here it is. On Wednesday, this show is going to be traveling to Flint, Michigan. We`re going to have a live town hall event in Flint. We`re going to be joined by some of the people who have been working day and night inside Flint to sound the alarm about the mass lead poisoning in that city. We`re going to be talking with the locals who are fighting to protect kids and families there, the doctor who exposed the danger of Flint`s water, the new mayor who`s been desperately trying to get any help for her city any way she could think of. This is going to be Wednesday night, next week, 9:00 p.m. Eastern, live from Flint – what happened, how it happened and I think what`s going to be some surprising, if not shocking news, about what`s going to have to happen next in that city.

Good evening to you both. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Good evening. LEE: Hi, Steve. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here we go, Linda. First question: Tuesday, we reported on Tuesday that New Jersey Chris Christie vetoed a New Jersey bill that wasn`t just bipartisan, it was actually unanimously passed in both the House and the Senate. Of course, Chris Christie is not just governor, he wants to be president. This bill is about guns. So, he killed it. What popular thing would that bill have done. Would it require, A, background checks for all gun sales, B, would it have banned fully automatic machine guns, C, would it have banned convicted carjackers from owning guns, or D, would it have banned presidential candidates from vetoing unanimously passed consensus gun legislation? LEE: Well, I believe it was item C. ', 'MADDOW:', ' On the carjackers. LEE: The carjackers. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Steve, did Linda get that one right, Steve? BENEN: Let`s check Tuesday`s show.

It`s just amazing. (END VIDEO CLIP) BENEN: It is just amazing. The answer is CNN and Linda is 1-1. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Excellent start. Question two, Linda, is from Wednesday. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been spending some of the mountains of money that was raised to try to elect him president. In addition to a glossy 47-page full color magazine all about Jeb Bush, his campaign this week also spent money FedExing out an expensive looking item to a bunch of early-state voterers. Which of the following is a real Jeb Bush campaign expenditure from this week? Was it A, a scientific calculator that displayed a message disparaging Ted Cruz? Was it B, a video player preloaded with a movie about Jeb Bush? Was it C, a free set of snow tires? Or D, an I`m with Jeb leather motorcycle jacket? LEE: Well, I believe it was item B, a player. ', 'MADDOW:', ' The video player. Steve, what`s the right answer? BENEN: Let`s check Wednesday`s segment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What Jeb Bush FedExed out to voters in New Hampshire is a video player which automatically starts showing his Jeb Bush movie as soon as you open it up. (END VIDEO CLIP) BENEN: Yes, the correct answer is a surprisingly nice and expensive- looking video player. And Linda is 2-2. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right, Linda, you are totally on a roll. And for this last one, here`s your curveball. You have a choice for your last question. Do you want a Donald Trump question or do you want a non-Donald Trump question? LEE: Aye yai yai, what a choice. Let`s go non-Donald Trump. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. The answer to the Donald Trump question was Oklahoma. But the non Donald Trump question was this. On last night`s show, we showed the homecoming of a former marine and a dual Iranian-American citizen who had been held in an Iranian prison for more than four years. His name is Amir Hekmati. And he arrived in his hometown last night, which happens to be a city that has been in the news for other reasons lately. Where is Amir Hekmati`s hometown? Is it A, Ferguson, Missouri?

       "' And thanks to you at home for joining with us this hour. Happy weekend. Happy Friday. OK, this goes in an unexpected place but trust me, you`re going to enjoy the ride. In May 2008, John McCain had all but wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. At that point, it was basically just a march to the convention for him. But sometimes candidates hit obstacles in their campaigns that weren`t put there by their opponents. It`s not because one of their rivals for the nomination or a candidate from another party has hit them with something particularly hard. Sometimes, candidates just make their own unforced errors. And John McCain did that in the spring of 2008 when he momentarily hopped into bed with a sort of high-profile guy who it turned out had very, very strong and strongly stated beliefs about among other things the Catholic Church.  That man`s name is John Hagee, a Texas pastor who preaches that the Catholic Church is the whore of Babylon that will be devoured by the antichrist. He also claimed that the great whore, aka the Catholic Church, drinks the blood of the Jewish people. John Hagee in the spring of 2008 endorsed Senator John McCain for president. And John McCain initially was psyched. He appeared with Pastor Hagee to accept his endorsement in person. He thanked him in person for the endorsement. He basically campaigned on that endorsement. But if the Catholic Church being the whore of Babylon wasn`t enough to sour that blossoming political alliance, eventually this part of John Hagee`s public life made the whole thing slightly untenable for Senator McCain. Do we have this clip from John Hagee? Oh, I think we`ll have it in just a second. This is – well, OK. Go ahead. Go for it. Roll it.  God sent Hitler. God sent Hitler. Well, John McCain could apparently endure some of the other things that Pastor John Hagee was known to have said about the Catholic Church and other topics. Pastor Hagee, for example, also blamed Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans having once hosted a gay pride parade. God sent the hurricane to New Orleans to punish them for gay people existing in public in that city. But when John Hagee said that the Nazis were doing God`s work, that Hitler was sent by God to kill the Jews, that was kind of a harder sell. And so, in May of 2008 John McCain, having accepted the endorsement and campaigned on the endorsement from John Hagee, he had to retroactively reject John Hagee`s endorsement and endure a few days worth of headlines like these, “McCain rejects Hagee backing as not (INAUDIBLE)” So, that was one bump on the road to John McCain being nominated as the Republican Party`s candidate in 2008. And honestly, you know what, candidates cannot be held responsible for everything said and done and believed by people who like them and endorse them and vote for them, right? But that`s why the Hagee debacle was such an unforced error on the part of John McCain. It would be one thing if John Hagee had just endorsed John McCain and John McCain had nothing to do with him, then he wouldn`t be responsible for vetting Pastor John Hagee and make sure that he didn`t, for example, think Hitler was doing God`s work. John McCain`s screw-up in 2008 was that he overtly welcomed the endorsement. And appeared with the guy and campaigned on the endorsement. And once you do that, you kind of own it, which somebody should explain sometime very soon to Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  Here we are again. God sent Hitler to chase the Jews. Now, that is not the guy who famously had to be renounced by John McCain in 2008. That wasn`t John Hagee who you just heard there. That`s a different guy. His name is Mike Bickle. And the Ted Cruz campaign just put out an excited statement proclaiming the Ted Cruz endorsement from Pastor Mike Bickle. Look, presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced the endorsement of Mike Bickle, founder and director of the International House of Prayer of Kansas City. Quote, “Heidi and I,” this is in Ted Cruz`s voice, “Heidi, my wife and I are grateful to have Mike`s prayers and supports. With the support of Mike and many people of faith, we will fight the good fight, finish the course, and keep the faith.” Part of what Mike Bickle teaches at his version of IHOP, the international house of not pancakes but prayer, is that God sent Hitler to chase the Jews, the Nazis were doing God`s work. Mike Bickle also famously says he can see in the United States today harbingers of the antichrist. Things that tell you the antichrist is coming. And you`d never believe who he thinks is the most nefarious one. Spoiler alert  Who? Oprah. Oprah Winfrey, harbinger of the antichrist. Seems unlikely, right? But that`s the whole point. Seems so unlikely. That`s how she does it.  That is who just gave a presidential endorsement to Ted Cruz. And that is the guy who Ted Cruz put out the official campaign statement proclaiming the endorsement thanking Pastor Mike Bickle for the endorsement. Ted Cruz is now campaigning on his support from this guy who says that Oprah is the harbinger of the antichrist, first reported by people for the American Way. And it will be interesting to see if the Republican Party has changed enough since 2008, right? Even though John McCain couldn`t endure holding on to this endorsement in 2008 from a guy who said that God sent Hitler to come hunt the Jews. That was not sustainable in Republican Party politics in 2008. It will be interesting to see if eight years later in 2016, Ted Cruz can stand to proclaim and welcome and be proud of the endorsement of a guy who said the exact same thing, that God sent Hitler to hunt the Jews, it was God`s will. That will be interesting to watch. Even just over this weekend. To see if Ted Cruz has to walk back his excited statement of support from the guy who says that Hitler was God`s Jew hunter. Whether or not that happens, though, this endorsement from Mike Bickle of Ted Cruz and his proclaiming of it, it also offers an interesting new angle on the fast escalating fight between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump on the campaign trail because it turns out one weird front of battle between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump is Oprah Winfrey. And you think I`m kidding, I know. But I`m not, because it`s very clear. Here`s Ted Cruz`s guy whose endorsement Ted Cruz is now campaigning on. Here`s what he thinks about Oprah.  Oprah. How you know the antichrist is on his way. That`s Ted Cruz`s guy. That`s how Oprah functions in the Ted Cruz for president campaign. Here is how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign. Here`s how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign.  That was Donald Trump the first time he flirted with running for president in the 2000 presidential campaign. He volunteered apropos of nothing that he was considering Oprah Winfrey to be his vice presidential running mate that year if he in fact mounted a bid for the presidency which he didn`t. That was the only name he ever floated as a possible vice president in the 2000 campaign. That wasn`t like people were asking him, “Hey, everybody likes Oprah, you`re friendly with Oprah, shouldn`t Oprah be your running mate?” No, he just brought it up. Vice president Oprah. That was a long time ago. That would have been the presidential campaign in the year 2000. But apparently, he is still thinking along those lines this time around.  In what is turning out to be kind of a Donald Trump-Ted Cruz death match at this stage in the 2016 presidential race one of the fronts of battle turns out to be Oprah Winfrey. It`s a pretty clear distinction, right? Harbinger of the antichrist or possible running mate. Choose. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump today also both broke new ground in their campaigns by unveiling straight up attack ads against each other. In terms of my assessment of these ads, I think they`re both about the same caliber, same quality, will have the same effect. I will say the anti-Trump ad by Ted Cruz does have one laugh out loud moment that I think you`re not supposed to laugh at.  Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both unveiling direct old school nasty style attack ads against each other today, ten days out from the Iowa caucuses. Neither of these candidates has spent very much money at all on advertisements thus far. They are both sitting on basically infinite funds. So, if Ted Cruz and Donald Trump decide to spend all of their infinite funds, throwing stuff like that at each other, the people of Iowa over these next ten days are going to be treating their TVs like a hazmat site, like not only are people not going to watch TV anymore, they`re going to throw blankets over their TVs just in case they wake themselves up and accidentally start showing that stuff and scaring the kids. Tonight, just as we were going to art FOX News Channel released their latest poll in the Republican presidential race. This is a national poll of Republican voters. What it shows is a very clear stratifying of the race. So, just look. This is a pretty good snapshot actually for this time of year. We`ll start at the bottom. At 1 percent, you`ve got Jim Gilmore and Carly Fiorina. Remember when Carly Fiorina was going to be a contender? Yes. At 2 percent, that`s Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, utterly unsustainable for those candidates. Rand Paul`s dad even did an interview with a conservative website this week in which he told the interviewer he`s pretty sure Donald Trump is going to beat his son and win the nomination. That could not have helped, dear old dad. Dad! That said, Ron Paul is expected to be out on the campaign trail with his Mr. 2 Percent Son. It will be Ron campaigning with Rand for the first time this year, first time this season. They`ll start this weekend. Up at 3 percent, it`s Chris Christie who just left the campaign trail in New Hampshire this afternoon to head back to New Jersey in the face of the oncoming blizzard. Tied for 4 percent nationwide it is John Kasich and Jeb Bush. The main difference between these two candidates right now is John Kasich has spent a total of about $11 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls and Jeb Bush has spent $59 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls. Unless Jeb Bush somehow pulls this out miraculously, he is going to be one of the most spectacularly expensive political failures of all time. So, that`s the lowest tier of candidates right now in national polling, according to this new FOX News polling that`s out tonight. Second tier has two candidates in it. Ben Carson is at 8 percent which is still low, but it`s double Jeb Bush. Marco Rubio is also in the second tier. He`s at 11 percent. On top of them, it`s the clear top tier of the Republican race indisputably now. Donald Trump is still way out ahead. He`s definitely the front- runner. He`s got 34 percent of the vote. The only guy up there with him at all anywhere near him is Ted Cruz with 20 percent. And so, it`s really starting to look like the race for the Republican nomination is a race between Donald Trump and just Ted Cruz. And frankly, if it comes down to that, I think we should let Oprah pick.  What are you doing Wednesday night? If you don`t have plans already, don`t make them. If you do have plans for Wednesday night already, how firm are they? We`ve got an announcement coming up in just a moment. We`re doing something on this show on Wednesday night. It`s something we have never done before. It`s kind of a big deal for us. That announcement is straight ahead. Please stay with us.  So, the federal government, the EPA, has now issued an 18-page emergency order to the state of Michigan and it`s pretty stern and it`s pretty dire. Quote, “EPA does not have information that would provide any assurance that contamination in Flint`s water system has been controlled.” And then in this order, they order the Rick Snyder administration to get on it, fast. They give the state of Michigan a series of really short deadlines. Within five days, the Snyder administration has to create a website where it has to post all its water testing results, all its testing plans, all its weekly status reports. Within ten days, the Snyder administration has to finally answer all the questions it never answered the last time the EPA asked the state for information about the lead in Flint`s water, which was back in November. And if you`re wondering how many questions the EPA had back then, yes. Look. It was a lot. And the Snyder administration has not been able to answer those questions for two months. Now, they`re under an emergency order that they`ve got to produce those answers in ten days. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to submit water quality measurements from Flint including ph, alkalinity, orthophosphates, chloride, turbidity, iron, calcium, temperature conductivity – they have to measure all of those things at ten sites every week and hand over the results. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to hand in all their lead testing results for Flint from the past three years. And within three days, the Snyder administration has to give the EPA a list of the zip codes in Flint where the highest blood levels have been found. It`s going to be a busy few days responding to this, right? Oh, but wait, there`s more. Because also in that ten-day window the Snyder administration is now ordered to hand over an inventory of homes in Flint, houses in Flint that are connected to the city water lines with service lines that are made out of lead. And they need to hand over that lead pipe inventory in a very specific way. They have to hand it over, quote, “in Excel spreadsheet or a similar format.” And I know you might be thinking, OK, so Michigan has to hand over a lot of data to the EPA, it`s not that big a deal, they can just send over their spreadsheets with all of that information. Here`s the thing, though – consider just one of the things the EPA is asking for, this spreadsheet. Excel or similar, right? A spreadsheet listing all of the homes in Flint that get their water through lead service lines. It`s important to know where they lead service lines are because then you know where you most need to test the water for lead, and you have to know it because those are the lines that are going to have to be dug up and replaced now that the untreated Flint River water has corroded them so badly that they will constantly leach lead into the water no matter how clean the water is that`s getting pumped through them. These again are the service lines that connect people`s houses to the water mains in the street. Back in November when the state finally started taking Flint`s lead poisoning crisis seriously, the state asked the city of Flint for this information. Where are all the lead service lines in the city? The city could not answer that question back in November. And when the folks at Michigan radio went to the Flint records office themselves to try to get the information themselves, they found out why the city couldn`t answer. And it`s amazing. Because it turns out these are Flint`s records of its water lines – filing cabinets full of disorganized handwritten index cards from the last 100 years along with a couple of old torn-up maps, more than 40,000 handwritten index cards. This is it. Flint has been in the process of trying to organize these records with the help of the University of Michigan, but you can see why if the EPA said we need a spreadsheet with all your lead service lines on it, we need it within 10 days, you can see why that might be a problem. And we`re now finding out this evening that might not be the only problem – at least according to the Snyder administration. The EPA did tell us tonight that Michigan has stated that it is committed to complying with this order, it is committed to implementing these measures, these things the EPA is asking for, but we have now also learned that the head of Michigan`s environmental agency has written to the EPA to say that the state, the Snyder administration, is questioning the legality of this federal order, questioning whether the EPA has the authority to order the state to take all these steps. Two sides are promising to try to talk this out, but right now, it looks like this could turn into a standoff between Michigan and the EPA, which is just what Flint needs. Hold that thought.  So, yesterday, the EPA, the federal government sent the Rick Snyder administration in Michigan an 18-page emergency order giving the state a list of things they have to do very quickly to start addressing the lead poisoning crisis in Flint. As we just mentioned, we have learned tonight that the Snyder administration is challenging the legality of that order from the federal government. One of the things the state is being ordered to do by the federal government is hand over a spreadsheet listing lead pipe service lines in the city of Flint. Michigan radio was first to report that – do we have this picture? That this is the existing data information system in Flint for where those lead pipes are. It`s tens of thousands of handwritten index cards. Joining us now is Lindsey Smith. She`s reporter for Michigan Radio. She and her colleagues there have been doing great work on this story. Lindsey, it`s really nice to have you here. Your reporting really has been indispensable.  What do you make of this letter we`re just learn about from the head of the state environmental agency saying we`ve spent all this money, we`ve done what you asked, and we don`t think you have the legal authority to order us to do anything. Is that just the expected response when something like this happens?  In terms of what the EPA is asking for or telling the Snyder administration they need to do, from what you`ve reported about how information is managed in Flint and what`s known about the systems there, thinking specifically about this deadline where they have to tell them where all the lead service lines are in all of the – for all of the homes in Flint, does it seem conceivable to you that the state could get that information together in electronic spreadsheet form within ten days?  And the federal government pressure certainly is going to add to the pressure. But it remains to be seen what their capacity is. Lindsey Smith, reporter for Michigan Radio, really appreciate your time tonight in helping us with this story. And again, Michigan Radio has done seminal work on this story so far. It`s been indispensable for us trying to follow it at the national level. So, thank you.  Thank you. I should also tell you, if we can go back there for a second. Thank you very much. I should also tell you that Michigan Radio`s documentary on this disaster in Flint is going to be airing on public radio stations across the country this weekend. You should check your public radio station listings for this. The documentary is called “Not Safe to Drink.” Again, check your local listings. They`re really, really good on this story. You owe it to yourself to hear this.  For the first seven-plus years that I had this show I could not get a Clinton on this show to save my life. I asked in the context of the 2008 campaign. I asked in the context of Hillary Clinton`s time as secretary of state. I asked in the context of her stepping down as secretary of state. I asked in a whole bunch of circumstances for an interview with former President Bill Clinton. I said I would travel, I said I would pretape, I`d do it live, anything. No dice. No Clintons for more than seven years. But then, tick, tick, tick, tick, ding. Something happened. A bell went off somewhere that allowed the circumstance to change. And now, during this presidential campaign over the last few weeks, I have had several opportunities to interview Secretary Clinton, which has been super helpful for our ability to cover this race. It`s been great. But in the first interview that I had with Secretary Clinton we had never met before after seven years of me asking for an interview. There was one question in that first interview that led to a little flurry of right-wing criticism at the time. And now today that issue is back. But in a very unexpected way. Here was the exchange I`m talking about.  One policy question that I think the Republicans are raising, they`re talking about amongst themselves – hasn`t really burst into a general election conversation yet, but I`m genuinely shocked by it. Which is it`s becoming sort of fashionable in Republican circles to talk about abolishing the V.A., privatizing the V.A., getting rid of it.  Throwing veterans onto the mercies of the for profit health care system. The reason they`re able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the V.A. seem so intractable. If I had been running a Republican campaign against President Obama last year, I would have run it entirely on the V.A. A bureaucracy, a bloated big government program that can`t be fixed and let`s do right by our veterans.  Do you – do you have any new ideas for trying to fix it? You can`t find a person in politics who doesn`t say we shouldn`t do right by our veterans. But for some reason, this can`t get fixed fast enough.  Much more so than people in the regular system.  Well, in part because there has been real scandal.  It has not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. Secretary Clinton went on to say that the V.A. needed to be reformed, she had specific things that she wanted to see changed to improve the V.A. But that comment, that part of her response about how widespread the problems were, that turned into like red alert, all caps, get out your fax machine hysteria on the right for about five minutes. Republicans professed to be very upset with that specific way that she characterized the problems at the V.A. despite everything else she said. Clearly, they said she was underplaying the terribleness of the V.A., she was apologizing for the V.A. when they implied the only right thing to say about the V.A. is that it should be condemned wholesale. And that little revolt on the right after that interview, that turned out to be a really instructive moment because there has been something quietly brewing on the right in the Republican Party, mostly under the radar but it bubbled up in that moment with Hillary Clinton in that interview, and it is coming up again right now for a completely backwards, opposite reason. And that story`s next.  One of the weird things about presidential politics this year is that almost to a person, the entire Republican presidential field this year is totally on board with abolishing the V.A., getting rid of the V.A. or at least privatizing huge swaths of it, telling veterans they`re not going to be provided medical care anymore, they can go get it themselves. So, when veterans get off the plane and come home from war, just set them loose into the private health insurance market to fend for themselves. Thanks for your service, good luck with that, here`s a coupon. This used to be a very radical idea. When Mitt Romney dipped his toe into the “privatize the V.A.” pool back in 2012, he got it chomped off so fast that he abandoned the idea immediately and basically never spoke of it again. But this year hasn`t been that long, only four years later, and this year almost the entire Republican field is in favor of abolishing or privatizing the V.A. in some way. And that didn`t just happen overnight, even though it happened fast. Candidates this year were led in that direction, in part by this group. This is a group called Concerned Veterans for America, a fairly new conservative veterans group. They have been quietly courting the Republican presidential candidates over the past year, and singing to them the virtues of getting rid of the V.A. They`ve held a series of town hall events with this year`s presidential candidates in the early primary states and one by one, the Republican candidates have dutifully said that, yes, they see the light, they too want to radically change the way veterans in this country get their care, in some cases to turn veterans over to the private health insurance market even though veterans themselves say they very much do not want that. Concerned Veterans for America has been led for a long time by this guy, seen here in his other job as a FOX News Channel host. Naturally. His name is Pete Hegseth. He`s a veteran himself. And about a year and a half ago, Mr. Hegseth let out a little secret about Concerned Veterans for America. He kind of spilled the beans on a thing that had long been suspected but was never actually verified until he said it out-loud. Which is that this ostensibly grassroots veterans group, this group that has been single-mindedly focused on trying to kill the V.A., turns out they`re not so grassrootsy after all. In fact, the “kill the V.A.” conservative veterans group didn`t arise organically out of the veterans community. It was a deliberate creation of the billionaire conservative activist brothers Charles and David Koch. And the reason we know that the Koch brothers donor network supposedly created the grassroots veterans group is because the head of that group, Pete Hegseth himself, admitted it while speaking at a Koch donor conference about a year and a half ago. This is audio of those remarks. It was obtained by an online outfit called “The Undercurrent”, was published by “The Nation”, although MSNBC has not independently verified it.  That is reportedly the Koch brothers guy at the end there saying, “You all as Koch network investors, you all are the ones who made this group happened, you created Concerned Veterans.” We reached out to the Koch donor network to see if they could tell us how much they have given this group and if they share this policy goal of killing the V.A. We haven`t yet heard back. But it`s kind of one of the sleeper issues of this campaign, that the Republican candidates have basically been captured by this Koch brothers- created, this Koch brothers-funded movement to kill the Veterans Administration. And now, in the midst of that effort with Iowa a week from Monday, with just a few months to go before the general election when presumably this issue is going to pop like you can`t believe it in the general election. I mean, imagine the fights about this at the general election debates. Right when all this kill the V.A. Koch brothers-funded organizing is about to blow up as an issue, the guy who has led that group, the guy who`s been at the forefront of this abolish the va movement since it started, he has just all of a sudden poofed. He`s just disappeared. He quit. He is no longer the head of Concerned Veterans for America, and nobody seems to know why. Hmm. Officially both sides are saying this was a mutual decision, we reached out to Concerned Veterans this week, they declined to provide any more details about what happened. Pete Hegseth told us himself he left over a, quote, “difference of opinion over the future of the organization.” And that`s basically all he would say. But regardless of the circumstances of his departure, what happens now? Because this is weird, right? This one group has been the driving force behind all of these Republican candidates getting on board with this incredibly radical idea of killing the V.A., making veterans fend for themselves in the private health insurance market to get their coverage, which brings a huge, totally hot button issue into the general election because, obviously, no Democratic candidate is going to stand for that and almost all of the Republicans want to do it. But now, the group that has turned this radical idea into mainstream Republican policy, they appear to be in the midst of maybe melting down themselves. This policy position on privatizing the V.A. or getting rid of it is now basically part of the Republican Party platform. It`s conservative orthodoxy now that the V.A. has to be burned to the ground and never rebuilt, good luck, vets. And if you disagree with that you have to be called out as a V.A. apologist. It was this Koch brothers-created group that helped push the Republican Party to that radical position. Now, their top guy has poofed right at the start of the election with no explanation whatsoever. So, what happens next here? And does that mean that the most radical plan to deal with veterans` issues in our country that we have seen in generations poofs with him? Watch this space.  I mentioned earlier that there was a big announcement coming. Here it is. On Wednesday, this show is going to be traveling to Flint, Michigan. We`re going to have a live town hall event in Flint. We`re going to be joined by some of the people who have been working day and night inside Flint to sound the alarm about the mass lead poisoning in that city. We`re going to be talking with the locals who are fighting to protect kids and families there, the doctor who exposed the danger of Flint`s water, the new mayor who`s been desperately trying to get any help for her city any way she could think of. This is going to be Wednesday night, next week, 9  It doesn`t sound like a snowplow. It`s not! It`s the Friday night news dump. Yay. Wendy McNeal, who is today`s lucky player?  Hi, Linda. I`m so happy to meet you.  Who is that with you? I can see little tufty ears.  How often does Petey get a hair cut?  You know, I know somebody else who`s in that bank.  I basically look middle aged pot belly lesbian wearing a black vest that like I always do.  You`re perfect, too, as is Petey.  A branded teeny, tiny Pomeranian-sized cocktail shaker. And for extra credit, we`ve got something truly random that we found in the office today. Wendy, can you describe the random office swag?  It is outdated. It`s the 2015 calander, but it is only gently used. But it is my personal trout calendar. So there you go, Linda, that`s what you`re playing for.  Can you still hear me now?  OK. Well, just real quick say hi to Steve from Maddow Blog. He`s going to determine if you have the right answer. Hi, Steve.  Good evening.  Here we go, Linda. First question  On the carjackers.  Steve, did Linda get that one right, Steve?  Nobody was opposed to the bill, except for Chris Christie because, of course, he`s presumably expecting a big endorsement from the carjackers league of New Hampshire, or something. It`s just amazing.  Excellent start. Question two, Linda, is from Wednesday. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been spending some of the mountains of money that was raised to try to elect him president. In addition to a glossy 47-page full color magazine all about Jeb Bush, his campaign this week also spent money FedExing out an expensive looking item to a bunch of early-state voterers. Which of the following is a real Jeb Bush campaign expenditure from this week? Was it A, a scientific calculator that displayed a message disparaging Ted Cruz? Was it B, a video player preloaded with a movie about Jeb Bush? Was it C, a free set of snow tires? Or D, an I`m with Jeb leather motorcycle jacket?  The video player. Steve, what`s the right answer?  What Jeb Bush FedExed out to voters in New Hampshire is a video player which automatically starts showing his Jeb Bush movie as soon as you open it up.  All right, Linda, you are totally on a roll. And for this last one, here`s your curveball. You have a choice for your last question. Do you want a Donald Trump question or do you want a non-Donald Trump question?  All right. The answer to the Donald Trump question was Oklahoma. But the non Donald Trump question was this. On last night`s show, we showed the homecoming of a former marine and a dual Iranian-American citizen who had been held in an Iranian prison for more than four years. His name is Amir Hekmati. And he arrived in his hometown last night, which happens to be a city that has been in the news for other reasons lately. Where is Amir Hekmati`s hometown? Is it A, Ferguson, Missouri? B, Porter Ranch, California? C, Burns, Oregon? Or D, Flint, Michigan?  I think lots of people are giving him that advice. Steve, do you have the answer for us?  Linda, you are perfect in every way. Wendy, did she win everything?  Again, out of date trout calendar, but I`ll sign it or put something else in there, I swear. Linda, it`s been great to have you here and it`s really nice to meet your pom, meet your little guy.  Well, thanks for being here. Congratulations.  Thank you. And if you want to play the most awesome game in basic cable news, also the only, send us an e-mail Rachel@MSNBC.com. And now, I have to tell you, you are due to go to prison for one minute. But before you do that, you really should pay attention to some big weather news.'"

      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 29, 2016 Guest: Hank Winchester, Benson Osazee CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: That`s “ALL IN” for this evening. THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now. Good evening, Rachel. ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, my friend. Hope you have a good weekend. HAYES: I will see you from Des Moines. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, when do you go? HAYES: I`m going Sunday. And I will see you Sunday evening on the camera machine. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you need to borrow any warm clothes? HAYES: I have warm clothes. Thank you very much. ', 'MADDOW:', ' OK, very good. I`ll see you then, Chris. All right. Thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. He`s foreshadowing something I`m about to explain in detail. You know, Fridays are supposed to be slow news days. Today was not a slow news day. We`ve got a big show coming up, including some news that broke tonight and in fact, it`s still breaking tonight in the state of Flint, Michigan, the mayor of Flint and the federal point person for the federal lead response called a last minute, unscheduled press conference to announce some very disturbing new information from Flint. So, we`re going to have the details on that ahead and when I say that this news still sort of still breaking tonight, we`re still trying to get our heads around exactly what has happened in Flint tonight. But it is bad news and local officials are sounding the alarm about it. Also in Lansing, Governor Rick Snyder`s office got strange today in the way that they are responding to the latest revelations about what they knew and when they knew it about what went wrong. Yesterday, we had revelations from the governor`s office that the Snyder administration had actually shipped purified workers to state workers who were working in the state office building in Flint even as they were publicly telling people who live in Flint that it was safe to drink from the tap. Today, the governor was questioned about that and his administration had a truly bizarre explanation, lack of explanation for what happened there and what they knew about it. So, we didn`t actually expect to have any news from Flint today, but both of those stories broke late in the day and we`re going to have details on those coming up. What we`re starting tonight with some additional late breaking news in national politics, one of the big differences between the Democratic and Republican presidential contest this year is that the Republicans have a lot more people running for president than the Democrats do, obviously in their giant field of candidates. Turns out they debate a each other a lot more than the Democrats do. Last night was the Republican debating, their final debate before the Iowa caucuses on Monday. As you know, Donald Trump the presidential front- runner decided he was going to sit out that last debate before Iowa. He said when he did his competing event that he sat out last night`s debate, quote, “out of respect for myself.” He sat out the debate he said because he does not like one of the FOX News hosts who was picked as a moderator for that debate. So, out of respect for himself, he didn`t go. Mr. Trump did do his own simultaneously solo event last night in Des Moines, a couple miles away from the debate site, while the other candidates were debating. If part of the stunt was Mr. Trump banking that last night`s debate would be boring without him and that people wouldn`t want to watch a Republican debate unless he was in it, there is at least some quantitative evidence that he was right about that. Last night`s debate was the second lowest rated for any Republican debate so far in this year`s race. The only Republican debate that rated any lower than last night was the one on the Fox Business Network. And it matters what outlet that was on because the Fox Business Network debate may have had the lowest ratings because not that many people actually get the Fox Business Network on their TV. People just have not had the option of watching it even if they wanted to. Last night, there was no excuse like that. It was on the FOX News Channel, which everybody gets who has cable, but they did not get a very good rating compared with the rest of the year. So, now we know, a Republican debate without Donald Trump in it does not rate well as a television vent. Now we know. How does it rate with voters? What will the effect of him skipping out on the last debate before Iowa in terms of the overall course of the race? Well, “The Des Moines Register” summed up last night`s Republican debate with this headline, “Rough Night for Ted Cruz.” Donald Trump skipping out on the debate a lot of people said made him the de facto winner of the debate because people had to talk about him even when he wasn`t there. It was also sort of a power move that made everybody else look weak for going to the debate when he struck out on his own, saying I don`t need that, I`m going to do my own thing – maybe. One of the other consequences, though, is that s it made all the focus of attacks of last night`s debate to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS MODERATOR: Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment. It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship, yes, it would. Press last month on why you supported legalization, you claim that you didn`t, right, like you just did. I saw that. You argued this was a poison bill amendment, basically something designed to kill the bill and not get it through. That is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don`t want this bill to be voted down. I don`t want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. That would fix the problem and also allow for those 11 million people here illegally a legal status with citizenship off the table. KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing. SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What is insulting is he`s the king of saying you`re for amnesty. Everybody`s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz. But it`s falseness. And that`s an authenticity problem. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is the lie that Ted ease campaign is built on. The truth is, Ted, throughout this campaign, you`ve been willing the say or do anything in order to get votes. Ted, you worked for George W. Bush`s campaigns. You helped design George W. Bush`s – you helped design George W. Bush`s immigration policy. CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS MODERATOR: Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you. Does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir? RUBIO: We`re not going to beat hill Clinton with someone who is willing to say or do anything to win an election. WALLACE: You have compared Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama saying we cannot afford another inexperienced president. Is either of them ready to be commander in chief? Governor Bush – CRUZ: Chris, I was mentioned in that question. JEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Your name wasn`t mentioned. WALLACE: I think the question was – (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: It`s not my question you get a chance to respond to. It`s his answer. You don`t get 30 seconds to respond with me. CRUZ: Your question was you have to disagree – (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: I`d like to go on. Sir, I know you like to argue about the rules but we`re going to contact the debate. CRUZ: Chris, I would note the last four questions have been, Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted. (BOOS) Let me just say this – WALLACE: It is a debate, sir. CRUZ: Well, no, a debate is a policy issue. But I will say this, gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It is a little hard to look presidential while at the same time complaining about all the people being mean to you. I think he noticed that affect that he was having in the room when he tried to turn it into the joke at Donald Trump expense at the end. But that was a hard thing to pull off. After last night`s debate, the Ted Cruz campaign referred to the overall race for the presidency now as a, quote, “two man race between Senator Cruz and Mr. Donald Trump.” The Cruz campaign wants people to think of this as Cruz versus Trump, one man versus one other man. The last two guys standing. But the Ted Cruz campaign`s advertising decisions today would seem to indicate otherwise. “New York Times” is reporting that the Ted Cruz campaign which again says this is a two-man race between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, the Ted Cruz campaign is now shifting nearly all their negative advertising from Donald Trump to Marco Rubio heading into Monday`s vote. Pay no attention to where we`re spending our money. It`s a two-man race between the guy that we have to start ignoring in order to fend off the other guy. It`s one thing to see a headline like this following the debate. It`s quite another to see a headline like this after the actual voting. If Ted Cruz is Donald Trump`s biggest threat heading into election night, he`s not on very firm ground heading into that fight. That`s what the polls like right now. We now had six straight polls showing Donald Trump in the lead in Iowa. Ted Cruz had been on the lead for a while, but at least six straight now show Donald Trump leading in Iowa. Then, after Iowa, it`s New Hampshire. And in New Hampshire, it`s every single poll taken since last summer which shows Donald Trump in the lead in that state, including the latest poll from Suffolk University in New Hampshire which shows Mr. Trump`s lead in New Hampshire as a robust 15 points. So, Donald Trump does look like he`s going to win. He looks like he`s going to win in the early states. He looks like he`s going to win the nomination. Our own Steve Benen at Maddow Blog compared Mr. Trump`s polling numbers at this point in the race with all other modern presidential primaries at this time. He found that there`s never opinion an instance in presidential campaigns for either party in the modern era in which somebody has been leading by this much in the polls both nationally and in the early states without going onto win the nomination. So, Donald Trump may not win the nomination, but if he doesn`t, it will be a historic political collapse of a kind we have never seen before in modern American politics. That said, even with his commanding lead in the polls in every state including Iowa, if you ask the beltway, the beltway seems to think that Donald Trump is probably not going to win in Iowa on Monday night. There`s this skepticism about his lead among beltway pundits, which, I don`t know, is casting more suspense about Monday that you might otherwise expect from numbers. That said, we don`t know what the impact will be of Mr. Trump`s skipping the last debate in Des Moines right before the Iowa caucuses. If there is a surprise victory by somebody else in the Iowa caucuses other than Mr. Trump on Monday night, even though he`s opinion leading in all these polls, nobody knows how that will affect his polling, nobody knows how that will affect everybody else`s polling, nobody knows how that will affect the polity and all the other states. So, this is a very exciting time if you care about politics. And as much, here is an important announcement. Sunday night, this Sunday night, this weekend, the night before the Iowa caucuses, exactly 24 hours before doors close at caucus sites all across the state of Iowa, 8:00 p.m. on Sunday night you have to watch MSNBC. I`m going to be anchoring special Iowa caucus coverage, along with Brian Williams and our whole MSNBC team, Chris Matthews is going to be anchoring from Iowa. Brian and I will be here in New York. Chris in Iowa and with a cast of thousands. This is a special broadcast of a time we`re not usually on the air, 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time Sunday night. Your attendance is mandatory. And then on caucus day itself, on Monday, our coverage of the Iowa begins at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time here on MSNBC. We`re going to be on the air, I think, from 6:00 p.m. until – I don`t know, what, 2:00 in the morning? We`ll see how it goes. But again, Brian Williams and I will be anchoring here from Rockefeller Center in New York City. Chris Matthews will be at the anchor desk in Iowa. We`re going to have cameras and reporters inside various caucus sites. We`re going to have the results here. You are going to spend election season 2016 with us starting Sunday and Monday night. So, woo-hoo! Sleep now. You`ll need it for later. We got lots more ahead tonight. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`d just mentioned that we got some late-breaking news tonight out of Flint, Michigan, that is not good news in terms of how things are going, in terms of the recovery from the lead poisoning disaster in Flint, Michigan. We`ve got that news from officials coming up in just a moment. But if you want to know what the recovery is going like in Flint from the people who are living it, we got a chance to ask some of the people who live there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MSNBC PRODUCER EMILY DREW: What do you want to see happen in Flint to make this whole situation right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A new pipeline for us to have water flowing from Detroit where ever we need to be so it`s clean fresh water for our people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The government needs to work together not as a separate faction here, separate faction there. Just work together for the common good of the people in Flint. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m afraid for the lasting effects it`s going to have on my 5-year-old daughter. My 15-year-old daughter had a rash. She went to the dermatologist. She broke out for three and a half months. We went through extensive treatment with the dermatologist. So, this is affecting our day-to-day lives because we don`t know what to expect. We don`t know the lasting effects of this will be and it`s very unsettling and very scary. I hope this government will do what it needs to do in order to correct the situation. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want us to have new pipes to get rid of this lead and after this a new water source. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it would be really nice if the governor could be hooked up to our system and he stay on the system until ours is corrected. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Your monthly bill this month is $110 for your water bill, $109.88? OSCAR BROWN, FLINT RESIDENT: One hundred nine eighty-eight. ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s pretty typical? BROWN: Sometimes it`s a little higher than that. Sometimes I want goes up to $115, $112. ', 'MADDOW:', ' But this is water that you`re using – BROWN: That I can`t use that I`m paying for. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You`re using it for flushing your toilet and that`s it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That`s it. BROWN: You`re right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All the other water you`re using in the house is bottled water. BROWN: Bottled water. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Have you been able to get bottled water for free? Have you been able to get it like from fire stations or anything? Have you been buying bottled water? BROWN: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The kids go – they started giving out water – BROWN: Giving out a couple weeks ago. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`ve been buying our water. BROWN: All year. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 2015 we`ve been buying water. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Since they made the switch, you`ve been buying. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`ve been buying our own water. Until three weeks ago, they decided to bring in the National Guard, Blue Cross – Red Cross and start giving waters to people. But one case per household is what they drop off. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. And you were – for more than a year before that, you`ve been paying for bottled water yourself in addition to paying your water bill for the water you can`t use. BROWN: Right. (END VIDEOTAPE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One visit from Governor Rick Snyder`s response team in the four months the governor – since the governor acknowledged that Flint`s water has been contaminated by lead. One visit. And the state dropped off a single case of water like it was a free Thanksgiving turkey instead of a full blown ongoing disaster created by Governor Snyder`s administration that left people unable to drink the water that is coming from their taps. One case of water, here you go in all this time. Late tonight, we got some bombshell news from Flint, late-breaking, unsettling news about conditions in Flint right now. It`s not clear that the state responds to this new development is anywhere near sufficient to the task, even now with the declaration of emergency and all the rest of it. But that new news is straight ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, we do have some late breaking news out of Flint, Michigan, tonight. At a hastily called press conference this evening, the mayor of Flint was joined by federal and state health officials who are all there. Again, this not been a previously scheduled press conference. They convened this at the last moment the announce results from the latest tests of drinking water around the city of Flint. These were tests of homes in Flint. And the results, which they – apparently, the testing was completed yesterday. They convened to announce tonight that the results of this testing in Flint homes now is still showing extremely high lead levels in a number of homes in the city. These are results that just came in. These are not historical levels of lead. These are levels from three months after Flint stopped using the Flint River as its water source, three months after new corrosion controls were put in place that were supposed to start making Flint`s pipes safe again. The lead levels at some homes tested are coming in at over 150 parts per billion. Now, the EPA threshold for mandatory action is 15 parts per billion. That means homes in Flint are testing at ten times the EPA limit. The other reason this news is so important is the filters that are being handed out that all residents are being urged to use on their taps, those filters are only certified to remove led up to 150 parts per billion. Filters are rated and certified by an organization called NSF, which originally stood for National Sanitation Foundation. And when it comes to filters being distributed in Flint, the NSF says they are only guaranteed to remove lead up to 150 parts per billion. Above that level, even if you`re drinking through the filter, there`s no guarantees that you are safe. And again, a number of these test results from homes in Flint right now were way above 150 parts per billion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: That`s the highest reading you found? ENGINEER MARK DURNO, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY: I don`t know the exact number but it was at least 4,000. REPORTER: And the tests – (INAUDIBLE) those were all collected during what period? DURNO: Oh, since the last week of December. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Hear that long pause there after the EPA official – the EPA official is asked what`s the highest level lead you found in testing Flint homes. He says, at least 4,000 parts per billion. Again, remember, the EPA threshold for mandatory action is 15 parts per billion. They are finding levels of 4,000. And this is testing done since the last week of December. And, so, tonight, these federal and state officials told Flint residents standing with the Flint mayor, told Flint residents that even if they have got a filter, unless they have had their water tested and they know the lead levels under 150 parts per billion, they are saying pregnant women and children under the age of six drink any water out of tap even if it has a filter. Oh, now you tell us. They also urged all Flint residents to get their water tested and to do that, they said conveniently, go to one of the five fire stations distributing lead testing kids and bring that sample collecting thing back to your house and you get a sample and take it back to the fire house and wait a few days. Now, there`s a three-day backlog and if levels are high, someone will call you to arrange further testing. Governor Snyder put out statement tonight after this very alarming test results came in, showing that the lead poisoning situation in Flint is still very bad and it`s not magically healing itself. Governor Snyder put out a statement that says this, quote, “It is essential that all Flint residents have the water in their homes tested as soon as possible. Please make it a priority for your family.” Please make it a priority for your family or Governor Snyder, you could make it a priority for your administration instead of asking people to go to the fire station and pick up a lead testing kit and bring it home and do the testing at your house and go back to the fire station with your sample kit and have them test it, and then somebody might call you within three days, and then they can arrange further testing. Instead, since you did declare this an emergency, you could go door to door and take lead sample from ever occupied home in the city. You could. Not everybody in Flint has easy access to get to the fire station and get this done and make it a priority for their family the way you want them to. Just this morning, Governor Rick Snyder said he hoped the water could be safe to drink in Flint in two to three months. He hopes the treatment they have added to the water, the corrosion control they`ve added to the water for the last three months, he said he hopes it`s already mostly recoated the pipes to keep them from leaching lead. Clearly from this testing results that we`ve got tonight, we know at least in some parts of Flint, that is not true. Today, Governor Snyder was asked again how much his administration knew about the growing water crisis in Flint over the last 18 months. E-mails surfaced yesterday showing that a year ago, state workers in Flint got bottle water shipped to them by the state because of concerns about Flint`s tap water, even as state officials were assuring Flint residents that the tap water was safe. Asked this morning about the clean, safe, purified water they made sure to give state workers, even as they were telling people who live in Flint that they should keep drinking from the tap, Governor Snyder said that he had, quote, “no knowledge of that taking place.” A Snyder spokesperson told “The Associated Press” today that that fresh, purified bottle water that they shipped into the state office building in Flint, that at least conceivably could have been drunk both by employees and by local residents. The Snyder administration said they didn`t know whether workers had promoted the water that they had in their offices as available to other people to drink but as the “A.P.” put it, quote, “No signs prohibited the public from drinking water from the cooler.” So, that was the plan, maybe. Maybe Flint residents will find their way into the state office building in Flint and find their way to the cubicle farms and find their way to the corner where the purified water has been provided by the Snyder administration for people who work in that building but not for anybody who lives in Flint and maybe that`s how Flint residents will get clean water shipped to them by the state that fouled their water and turned it poisonous. They can just find it in the office building. Snyder administration confirmed for us today that the bottle water delivery to the state office building in Flint, it continues to this day. So, maybe if you are having trouble getting clean water in Flint, just carry a big jug down to the state office building and ask if you can fill it up there? That`s the only water they are shipping regularly into any facility in Flint. Other than the fire station where is you can pick it up if you have a car or you can catch a ride and pick up your one case that`s allotted to you every day if you can pick it up yourself. But, hey, Rick Snyder said he had no idea state workers were getting safe water so they wouldn`t have to drink the water in Flint. He had no idea. There`s a lot of things that Governor Rick Snyder claims to have had no idea about over the last 18 months from the rising levels of lead in Flint water to the rising level of lead in children`s bodies in Flint, to the warnings about the high lead from the EPA. He said he had no idea about any of that. It would be nice if we could fully investigate what Rick Snyder actually knew and when he knew it. It would be great if we could see for instance e-mails and documents from him and his staff in 2013 when this decision was made to use the corrosive Flint River as Flint`s water source without treating it properly so it wouldn`t lead poison the town. We don`t have access to that information. We have asked Governor Snyder to release those 2013 e-mails. He hasn`t released any of them. Now, at least though, somebody else is asking, the United States Congress. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote asking him for all documents related to the drinking water supply in Flint, including the decision to switch the Flint`s source of water, and including emails sent to or receive by or members of your staff. If Rick Snyder declines to provide this material to this congressional investigating committee, the Democrats on that committee say they could ask the Republican leadership to subpoena those documents from Rick Snyder and the Republicans would have to decide if they want to give him a subpoena or not. In asking for these documents, Democrats in Congress are calling a very interesting question for Governor Snyder, and if he doesn`t answer, then for Republicans in Congress. Does the public get to see what Governor Snyder knew? Does the public get to see how this happened? And meanwhile in Flint, this crisis is not getting better. Attention is not the same as fixing it. People talking about it national level, national news coverage doesn`t mean that the lead levels are going down. With this news tonight of super high lead levels in a number of homes in Flint, lead levels that far and away exceed the amount of lead that filters are certified to protect you from, it is yet further information that we seem like we`re getting every day that this isn`t over. And maybe this is just how the story goes for a while. Maybe they there will be really high levels of lead in Flint. If you`re living there and drinking this water, if you`ve been using a filter to protect your family, then news that that filter might not work for the amount of lead you have in your water is going to be very scary news indeed. Joining us now is Hank Winchester. He`s a reporter with WDIV, which is the NBC station in Detroit. Hank, it was good to meet you when I was in Flint this week. Thanks for joining us tonight. It`s nice to see you. HANK WINCHESTER, WDIV-TV INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: Thank you, Rachel. Great to see you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, it seemed to us here that this announcement tonight was unplanned. This was not a press conference we planned all day to be covering. This doesn`t seem like a regularly scheduled thing. Did you have much warning they would convene this press conference tonight to announce these new test results? WINCHESTER: We had about 15 minutes. We got the e-mail notice and we were in our live truck in downtown Flint and the team from Washington stopped at the truck, banged on the door and say we want to make sure you know about the press conference. We packed up and got to city hall rather quickly. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And in terms of what was announced there, basically, what they`re saying is we`re doing testing now. A number of homes are testing over 150 parts per billion. That`s ten times the EPA standard and above what the filters are certified to be able to handle. We`ve been telling everybody to drink filtered water. The consequence of that is that filters aren`t enough. That if you haven`t had the water level – the lead levels in your house tested, don`t trust the filter. Only use bottled water. That`s new advice to the people of Flint, isn`t it? WINCHESTER: It is. It`s very concerning, especially in the cases that you mentioned we heard from the official during the press conference. One home testing 4,000 parts per billion. Now, remember, after 150, the filter is obsolete. So, now, you`re telling the people do not drink the water if you`re pregnant, if you`re a small child. What I did appreciate today and what I`m sure appreciate it also, was how quickly the information got to the people in is not case where e-mails were being exchanged for months and meetings were taking place in different test results were coming. These numbers came in late yesterday. They looked at them today. They got with Dr. Mona, who I know you know well. They got with the mayor and the team on the ground and they worked to get that information out to the media and public as quickly as they could. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And at the start of the press conference, Karen Weaver, the mayor of Flint, comes out and you can tell she`s under the weather. She`s sick herself and she came out and said one of the things I committed to is making sure you know everything I know, that people of Flint have access to all the information that I have access to and that`s why we have hastily convened this announcement to let you know. They`ve also I should tell you published online the Excel spread sheet showing the results of all of those individual tests, including the street addresses of individual homes and what the lead and copper ratings are for tests in each of those places. Hank, one of the things that I saw in Flint and one of the things I`ve been hearing from people consistently is that a lot of people, even though they know they should have filters on, a lot of people still don`t or they don`t fit properly or they don`t necessarily have cartridge inserts to change them out. The word is out that people ought to be using filtered water. This will complicate that tonight. What`s your sense of the compliance rate in terms of people using filters despite the advice? WINCHESTER: I think it`s gotten better. But you remember, it was just about a week ago when we were in Flint reporting the fact that many fire stations had run out of filters. So, you know, the governor has stepped up those efforts. More National Guard members on the ground. There are more filters available. But just a few weeks ago, people were making their way the fire stations, all over the city. And for some people, it`s difficult. They walk to these fire stations. They take the bus. Some are lucky enough to have a vehicle. And they would get up there and find out there`s no water and no filter available. So, I think for some people who are dealing with this situation for more than a year, they figured if I`m not going to get a filter when I go up to the fire station, what`s the point. The warnings have been put out there. People understand that it is important, and today, I really think that was the key moment for the mayor to say, listen, if you`re not using a filter, please do, but understand we want you to test your water because of these alarming test results. Everybody has to be on the same page now. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And again, what – I think this is a very important though in terms of what you were describing about getting down to the logistics of getting down to the fire station and collecting these things, they are telling people, even if you got a filter, don`t drink the water through filter unless you`ve had lead testing in your home. In other to get lead testing in your home, they are still telling people that means get yourself down to the fire station. Get lead testing kit from the fire station, bring it home, get the sample. Bring the sample back to the fire station and you`ll be contacted in three days. I mean, asking people to do that logistically instead of sending around trucks to do lead testing in house after house after house is still a big logistical ask which is going to mean a lot of houses won`t get tested. WINCHESTER: It`s true. It`s a big problem. They have been able to get water from the fire stations out into the neighborhoods because some of these people are seniors. And again, some people don`t have transportation to make their way to the fire station. So, you have to figure out a better plan to make sure we are testing everybody`s water. When we see numbers like this and understand that there are some homes where filter is just not going to do anything to help these people, we have to have a better understanding of what the lead levels are in every single home in Flint. That has to be done before they can decide how they will tackle the problem. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, and it has to be done in a door to door way. You can`t be asking people to asking people to take responsibility for doing – it`s just – it`s incredible. Hank Winchester, correspondent for WDIV in Detroit, thanks for your reporting on this. Hank, it`s nice to see you. Appreciate it. WINCHESTER: Good to see you too. We look forward to seeing you back in Flint soon. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I have a feeling I`m going to be back sooner than I thought I would. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Hank. We`ve got much more on this story and much more. Stay ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, there`s some news to report about one of stranger and more unexpected innovations of this year`s presidential cycle, the kids table, also known as the happy hour debate, also known as the undercard debate. The kid`s table last night`s Republican debate on the FOX News Channel was apparently the last one or at least it`s likely to be the last one. The next Republican debate is a week from tomorrow. It`s being hosted by ABC News. And ABC just announced that their debate, the next Republican debate, will not feature a kids table or rather in announcing their criteria for candidates qualifying for the next debate, ABC didn`t bother to mention that they are killing the kid`s table. It was up to reporters to follow up with the network and confirm that they are not planning on doing one. So, that means last night`s Jim Gilmore, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee fest is going to be the last one. Kid`s table, we hardly knew you. It was a weird thing to invent for this year`s presidential political cycle, but I guess it`s the last one. There is one other thing to note. Last night because it will be the last one and because we`re about to have voting in Iowa, it`s hard to imagine when we`re going to see these guys in any circumstance at all. I mean, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum cannot qualify for a main stage debate anymore to save their lives. After participating in the kids` table last night, those two guys promptly headed over to Donald Trump`s special event for veterans. They got in on Trump event while trying very desperately not to stand behind the Trump podium. But honestly, that will be probably be the last time any of us will see them in a political context. On stage with Donald Trump trying not to appear to next to up with of the Trump campaign logos. Rick Santorum, king of the kids` table, the only candidate to successfully qualify for and participate in every single one of the seven kids` table debates so far, he`s likely going to have the his big primetime public appearance on stage with Donald Trump or possibly if somebody covers is concession speech on Monday. Rest in peace, kids table debate. I`m not sure we`ll miss, but I think we`re about the see the last of you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I never liked screwing up. Nobody does. But I am happy to make a correction when I do screw up. I do have a correction I need to do. It involves Bernie Sanders and also Hillary Clinton and honestly, if I dig far enough it probably involves Martin O`Malley, maybe Lincoln Chafee too, possibly even Jim Webb. Mea maxima culpa coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Hey, so, quick point of fact. A little correction. I said earlier in the week that the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns had released these ads as their closings arguments in Iowa. These two ads were likely to be the last things the people of Iowa were going to see or hear from these candidates in terms of ads before Iowans go to vote in their caucuses on Monday night. I was wrong. Turns out that neither the Bernie Sanders inspirational ad nor the Hillary Clinton biographical ads were the final campaigns are airing in Iowa. I was incorrect on both counts. Instead, the Bernie Sanders campaign has since launched this totally different ad about what he describes as the rigged economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AD NARRATOR: They`re one of the Wall Street banks that triggered the final meltdown. Goldman Sachs just settled with authorities for their part in crisis that put seven million of out work and millions out of their homes. How does Wall Street get away with it? Millions of campaign co contributions and speaking fees. Our economy works for Wall Street, because it`s rigged by Wall Street. And that`s the problem. As long as Washington is bought and paid for, we can`t build an economy that works for people. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I`m Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, after what I said was his closing argument, after, Senator Sanders released that campaign ad. Also, after what I said was her closing argument, the Hillary Clinton campaign launched this new ad in Iowa. It`s titled “Thank You”. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really wanted to start with a thank you. I want you to know how much it`s meant to me as I`ve traveled across the state to hear about people`s hopes and struggles. I know that because of that, I will be a better president if I`m elected. If you go to the caucus on Monday night and stand up for me there, I will work my heart out to give you and our country the future that we deserve together. I`m Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, yes, I can say with no confidence at all that those will be the closing argument ads. That maybe those will be the last ads that Iowans will see from the two major Democratic candidates before it`s time the vote, maybe. Actually, probably not. The point is we won`t know what they`re closing argument is, from either campaign, until there`s no more arguing, right? Until the voting has started in Iowa. So, who knows if that`s going to be the last word from Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton? That`s the latest word for them. And there`s no need to jump the gun. Time is short now. Caucuses start Monday at 8:00. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' If you`re really excited about the Iowa caucuses and you want to get a chance to see the candidates before the caucuses start. There are a couple of opportunities to see candidates in various places tomorrow. For example, at 10:00 a.m., Marco Rubio will be at a Sioux City rally. At 10:15. Ted Cruz will be in Hubbard, Iowa. At 12:00 Bernie Sanders will be in Manchester, Iowa. Chris Christie at noon will be in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In noon also, Ted Cruz will be in Ames, Iowa. Twelve-forty-five, Hillary Clinton will be in Ames, Iowa. Fifteen minutes later, Marco Rubio will be in Council Bluffs. At 1:30, Jeb Bush will be in Clear Lake, Iowa. At 2:00, it will be Bill Clinton in Iowa Falls. At 2:00 also, Donald Trump will be in Dubuque. At 2:15, Bernie Sanders will be in Charles City, Iowa. At 3:15, it will be Ted Cruz in Hamlin, Iowa. At 3:30, it will be in Bernie Sanders in Waverly, Iowa. Hillary – that`s we`re just getting close to 4:00. Do you want me to keep going? It`s getting busy. We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here it comes. Woo-hoo! Friday Night News Dump time! Kent Jones, who is playing today? KENT JONES: Tonight`s guest is Benson Osazee from Houston, Texas. He is an ICU nurse. He has lived in Texas for 18 years. He has three children. Rachel, please meet Benson Osazee. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Benson, it is very nice to meet you. Thank you for playing.

Benson, meet Steve. STEVE BENEN, MADDOW BLOG: Good evening to you both. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Hello. All right. Here we go. First question: this one`s from Monday night`s show and on Monday night`s show, we reported that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was taking heat for campaigning in New Hampshire while New Jersey was still cooping with some intense post blizzard flooding. When Governor Christie was confronted with that criticism at a town hall in New Hampshire, he sarcastically asked his questioner if she wanted to see him personally handle the clean up in New Jersey. So, here is your question, Benson. What hypothetical task did Governor Christie offer to do? A, drive a snowplow. B, mop. C, work the traffic cones. Or d, personally rebuild a sand dun. OSAZEE: OK. Let`s see. Not A. Not C. Mop. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Mop. The answer according to Benson is mop. Steve, did he get that right? BENEN: Let`s check Monday`s show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What do you want me to do, do you want me to go down there with a mop? (END VIDEO CLIP) BENEN: The correct answer is B and Benson is one for one. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yay! All right. Next one is from Tuesday night`s show. Tuesday night, we reported that a prominent politician and a noted civics dork, and I mean that in a positive way, Missouri`s Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, she very excited checked off an item that she said was on her bucket list. What was that item? A, she got to drive one of the little subway trains that runs under the U.S. Capitol. B. she got to bang the gavel to open a session in the U.S. Senate? C, she got to trade desks with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania so now she gets the desk that has all the candy in it. Or D, she got jury duty. OSAZEE: Not A. Not B. Jury duty.

You`re obviously a ringer. Last question for you, Benson. OSAZEE: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Last night`s show we reported on what happened the last time Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tried to do a campaign event to benefit veterans. This is something that happened last September in San Diego. The group that was announced recipient donations from that event was a sort of shady group that had its nonprofit status revoked by the IRS. Last night, we reported that that group, Veterans for a Strong America, is no more. They have dissolved themselves and they have reformed themselves under a different name. What is the new name for the artist formerly known as Veterans for a Strong America. Are they now, A, Vets for a Strong America, B, Veterans for a stronger America, C, Veterinarians for a Strong America, or d, Donald Trump presents Veterans for a Strong America? OSAZEE: Not C.

      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 28, 2016 Guest: Paul Rieckhoff ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Thanks, my friend. CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: You bet. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. So, there`s a lot going on tonight in news and in politics in the wake of our big town hall in Flint, Michigan, last night. There was big, stunning and, in my opinion, fairly infuriating new news today, new revelation today in Flint that broke in Michigan press late today. It`s about the state government, the Rick Snyder administration, knowing that the water was bad in Flint before they said anything publicly. And in fact, what was revealed today was that the Snyder administration appears to have taken action to protect its own employees from Flint`s water while they were still telling the people of Flint that it was safe to drink. As I said, it is my opinion but I find this fairly infuriating. And we`re going to have that story ahead tonight. That`s just broken late today. We`ve also got the latest polling out in the presidential race which shows sort of a rather unsettled picture on the Democratic side. In the early states, a much more settled picture on the Republican side, with frontrunner Donald Trump holding a commanding lead not only nationally but pretty much at all the early states, too. It does, of course, remain to be seen what the effect will be of this curveball decision just made by Mr. Trump to skip the last debate before the Iowa caucuses. Now, this is not a totally unprecedented move by a presidential front- runner. In previous election years, this sort of thing has happened. But it`s only very rarely happened. This is an almost unprecedented event and we don`t know how it`s going to affect his lead. We don`t yet know how it`s gong to affect the overall course of the race. But Mr. Trump, it should be noted, he`s not just opting out of last debate. He is counter programming basically. That`s the event you`re looking at a live shot of here now. We`re watching to see when this one will get started. This event is just a couple of miles away from where the other Republican candidates are debating tonight. Mr. Trump is not going to the debate. Instead, he`s convening his own event at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. And he`s calling this a fund-raiser for veterans. Although given his past history of trying to wrap himself up in veterans glory and purporting to raise money for veterans when he doesn`t seem to have actually done that, that assertion should be taken with a grain of salt, roughly the size of the rock of Gibraltar. So, we`re going to be talking live with Paul Rieckhoff, who`s the head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America. We`re going to be talking with him about that event. We`re going to be talking about also the way that veterans are being treated by Mr. Trump`s campaign and also by the campaign in general. Paul has had some choice words and some edgy things to say about the stunt that Trump is pulling tonight in veterans` names. But that veterans event is what we are waiting to get started right now at Drake University in Des Moines. In terms of the opting out of the debate part of this. There`s been a couple of instances in modern history where a front running candidate has opted out of debate. You can see Mike Huckabee entering the room. We`re expecting Mike Huckabee and possibly one or maybe even two other Republican candidates to appear tonight at this Donald Trump event. They are not boycotting the other debate. The other candidates who are expecting to appear at this event were people who are at the kids table, people who are sort of at the undercard debate. So, their work is done. And rather than just sit at home and watch the big stage debate, some of the kids table debate kids have decided that they will come over to the Trump event and do the boycott event and the boycotted event in the same night. Why not? It`s only a few miles away. Cheap on Uber, right? We just saw Mike Huckabee. I`m not sure if we`ve seen of the other kids table candidate there yet. I also have to say, given who is at the kids` table tonight, I`m not exactly sure I would recognize all of them, so I might need some help from the control room on that. In terms of the decision to boycott this debate, though, if you think about it, in politics broadly, when you are a front-runner, when you are leading, you do not necessarily want to do anything to change the trajectory that you`re on, but it looks like you`re going to win, particularly if you`re not a good debater or up against very good debaters. If you`re a front-runner and you have the chance to opt-out of a debate, it`s not out of the question that you might do that. That happened once in 1980. The interesting thing about the way it happened in 1980 is that was going to be the first ever nationally televised Republican primary debate. It was the night before the Iowa caucuses in 1980. And Ronald Reagan thought he had Iowa wired. Thought he was going to win and also thought that George H.W. Bush was a better debater than he was. And so, Ronald Reagan made a decision the night before the Iowa caucuses in 1980 that he would sit out that debate. The next day in Iowa, George H.W. Bush beat him in Iowa. That was sort of widely viewed in Reagan campaign as having been a bad decision that he didn`t participate. They do think it cost him Iowa even if he did go onto win the nomination that year. It didn`t really happen again in a high profile way until 20 years later, the 2000 presidential election when George W. Bush was the prohibited front runner. George W. Bush got in and basically raised so much money so fast and locked up so many establishment endorsements that he clear cleared the rest of the field that year. And when George W. Bush was out ahead of the field in 1999 heading into the 2000 presidential race, he made a decision in the fall of 1999 that he would start skipping debates in New Hampshire. And again, he was way out ahead. He did not think he was going to be a good debater. He thought if things keep going the way they are going, he would win. George Bush skipped out of two debates right before the New Hampshire primary and went on in the year 2000 in that Republican primary to lose New Hampshire. So, again, like Reagan, he went onto win the nomination again any way. But it is a risky thing to opt out of a debate, particularly when it`s a debate that is narrowly targeted to one of the early states or indeed comes right before one of the early states. So, it`s been a good run I think for the Republican candidates in terms of their debate schedule thus far. They`ve had massive audiences for their debates. But Donald Trump hasn`t really shined in any of them. I think it`s fair to say that Mr. Trump`s prohibitive lead as the Republican frontrunner is not necessarily due to his performance in any of the debates. He hasn`t had stand out moments that`s pushed his numbers up. It`s the rest of his campaign that`s done well for him, candidates who have benefited from the debates have been other people who pushed back at him or gotten in a sort of zinger at his expense. He hasn`t been winning at the debates. He`s just been holding firm. Perhaps Mr. Trump has decided he did you wan doesn`t want the change the trajectory that he`s on. Perhaps Mr. Trump has decided he`s tired. Perhaps Mr. Trump has decided that this is not a cowardly thing to do, rather a bold, brave thing to do to defy what everybody else is doing, to defy the Republican Party and its schedule, and basically just sit out of the race and counter-program and guess that everybody might cover him instead. If he were just doing this on his own terms, if he were just saying, hey, look, I`m Donald Trump, I`m doing a campaign rally across town, instead of doing the debate, I think that would be the level of analysis we would be at. There is another element of this, which is that Mr. Trump is not just opting out of tonight`s debate. He is doing a separate event, hastily pulled together, which he`s calling a fund-raiser for veterans. That has a long history just in this campaign. Mr. Trump has done there before. We don`t exactly know what that will mean in terms of a political matter. But it does matter to veterans. And we know that because of some of the stances that have been taken publicly by veterans groups. One of the strongest stances taken by a veterans group in this country has been by the founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Paul Rieckhoff is the founder and CEO of IAVA. And he made news this week by saying that if IAVA were offered profits from this event tonight, IAVA would not accept them. Paul, it`s great to have you here. Thanks for being here. PAUL RIECKHOFF, IAVA FOUNDER AND CEO: Good to see you. Thanks for having me. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You`ve got a lot of attention for saying that. And I went through the trouble of looking at all your Twitter responses on that, trying to sort of twing the guitar strings there and see what the responses. What has the response been? RIECKHOFF: I think from the majority of the veterans community, it`s been supportive. I think folks feel that veterans have been overly-politicized by both parties and for decades. And I think there`s a bigger issue here. I mean, the days of veterans issues being a place for nonpartisanship, for being a place of unity, being kind of off-limits from the non-sense of normal politics are gone. Those days are long gone. I think, you know, Trump`s always been a populist. He knows what attracts the huge swath of American people. Veterans are very popular. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. RIECKHOFF: You know, we`ve said for years, it`s kind of like babies, puppies and vets. Everybody loves veterans. So, to use veterans will definitely appeal to a huge percentage of the population, but the veterans groups don`t want to be used as pawns. So, I think most of the veterans groups in America will decline donations. It`s not just from Trump but every candidate. And that`s what we`ve said as well. We`re not going to take money from any candidate. We all need support. We definite need support. Rather than a couple million dollars we would like to hear how will you transform, for example, the V.A., which is $170 billion. If you really want to help veterans, let`s hear your strong policies and specific policies on how you`re going to address the issues that matter the most. ', 'MADDOW:', ' One thing that occurred to me about the specifics of this event tonight, we`ll talk more about this detail later on. But we don`t exactly know where the money is going. He set up a website today where the money comes to him, comes to his Donald J. Trump Foundation and then he says he will turn it around to veterans organizations. Seems to me like if candidates, for good reasons or bad reasons, right, for craven reasons or noble reasons, if they do want to raise money for vets as part of their campaign, one of the ways to do that is to say, I`m going to charge you, charge you to get into this event in order to come here. You need to donate x amount of money to one of these lists of veterans organizations. RIECKHOFF: Right, right, right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right. Give people about information about how to contact veterans groups and let them donate on their own terms. That would presumably be less problematic for you. RIECKHOFF: You know, if people want to donate, they can do it without going through a political campaign. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, exactly. RIECKHOFF: That`s the bottom line. And there`s definitely a need. Every veterans organization that`s on the front line has seen a spike in demand, and the supply overall philanthropically has been declining. So, we need support from people across America but we don`t need to be used as political props. And this has happened again and again. Trump has used this line effectively. It`s become the new applause line. It`s becoming the new “I`m going to clean up Washington”, right? Instead of I`m going to clean up the Washington, say, I`m going to clean up the V.A. Sounds great. Everybody love it. But how are you going to do it? That`s the hard part. What are you going to do about the V.A. secretary? How are you going to care for women`s veterans. How are you going to approach the suicide rate? Those are the hard things. Fixing the V.A. may be the hardest thing for a president. So, it could be a defining issue. As you`ve noted, it`s divided the parties. They are very different perspectives on how they`re going to attack that in particular. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And so, there is when you are using it as applause line, there`s all the more moral requirement that you know what you`re talking about and talking about it substantively. RIECKHOFF: Now, it`s become arms race. It`s become “I love veterans more than you” arms race. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right. RIECKHOFF: Right? And now, Cruz responded and Fiorina responded. I`m sure others will do the same. Maybe in the end, there t will be a silver lining that we`ll more attention on veterans issues, but we really need debates on veterans issues. We need moderators to ask tough questions. We need candidates to answer them. In all the debate, there`s been almost no focus on veterans. No question and no policy. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Again, applause lines and there`s substance. RIECKHOFF: Paul, stand by. We`re going to bring you back in once we hear what Mr. Trump has to say on this subject tonight. I want to bring in NBC special correspondent Tom Brokaw. Mr. Brokaw, it is great to see you. Thanks for being with us tonight. TOM BROKAW, NBC NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Great to be here, Rachel. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is there important historical precedent? Is there good historical analogy for seeing what Mr. Trump is doing here? A candidate of his stature in the race, skipping out on the last big debate before voting starts? BROKAW: Well, I`m sure that whatever veterans group get whatever he raises will be grateful for that. But as you have been discussing there, there are over-arcing needs that the veterans need addressing. It`s not just a one time or a one shot event. Now, Mr. Trump has said that he`s supported veterans groups in the past all across this country, Rachel, groups are supporting veterans. But they`re doing it by and large below the radar, doing the best they can in their communities and in wider ways and they`re not using it for their own advantage. The veterans come first. I`ve dealt with a lot of them. People are writing big checks. Sports organizations are doing what they can to help. I was at Texas stadium earlier this year. Ands they had a group in Dallas that raised money for service dogs. Jerry Jones wanted them to do that at half time at a Cowboys game, so everybody could see what was going on. Jerry Jones didn`t appear down on the field. It was really about the veterans and the dogs and the help they could give. So, I think that`s what the country has to stay focused on, quite honestly. I wouldn`t want this to be the template for how you treat veterans or how you raise money for them. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Tom, because it is – it`s very transparent what`s going on here. Mr. Trump has a website he set up. It`s a website he registered today. The money that he`s raising goes to his foundation. This is obviously an ad hoc thing, out of politically salient moment for him. And as you, in your words, he`s sort of doing this for his own advancement and not in a transparently impure way. Does that have potential to have political backlash? Do people see that transparently enough that it ends up hurting him because it looks craven? BROKAW: Well, it`s hard to speak for all the people, because obviously he`s said some things this year that quite honestly we didn`t think he could get away with. He said this on television, all those Muslims celebrating in New Jersey that was patently not true, but it didn`t seem to damage him at all, in fact, his ratings went up afterwards. So, it`s very hard to forecast how all of this is going to impact Donald Trump and what the country will respond to. He is playing it seems to me a kind of a dangerous game when you bring in the veterans, because they should have a sacred place in America. And I think more people and more communities across America don`t need to be looking at what we`re seeing here tonight. They need to find the veterans in their town. There`s a lot of them in small towns, Rachel, who came back wounded, got a lot of attention at the beginning. Now they are home with their wives and wives are having to carry the big struggle and so are the children. That`s the way to get things done. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you think that the presidential election process, that the primary process in either party is capable of moving the debate forward in the kind of substance that Paul Rieckhoff was just talking about, actually extracting from these candidates plans and promises that might meaningfully move forward the issue about how to support veterans and reform the V.A. and lall those things. BROKAW: Well, I think one of the disappointing things not just at this campaign but any primary campaign in the most recent cycles is there`s not been a lot of details spelled out – ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`ve just lot Tom Brokaw`s audio. Are we able to get that back? I could see he was still speaking but I could hear him. OK. We`ll go back to tom when we get that. That`s a drag. What you`re looking at here on the left side on your screen is this event that is due to start momentarily, being – hosted by Donald Trump. He is calling it a veterans event. And that`s why we have Chyron out there, that`s the line on the screen there. We`re not sure exactly who Donald Trump is raising money for tonight nor do we know how much money is expected to be raised. But here comes Mr. Trump. We also don`t know how long he`s going to speak or how substantive these remarks are going to be. Let`s see what he does. This is his counter programming to the debate. (APPLAUSE) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That`s so nice. Thank you. Thank you, man. There`s a vet. There`s vet. We love our vets. Thank you, everybody. Sit down, please. We had about 24 hours to put this together. It was very, very quick. And we`re here for some very special people. We`re going to hear from some of them. But this is an honor. This is a real honor. I didn`t want to be here. I have to be honest. I wanted to be about five minutes away. I`ve enjoyed that. I`ve enjoyed that. All the online polls said I`ve done well with that, with the debates. And I`ve have a kick with it, but you have to stick up for your rights. When you`re treated badly, you have to stick up for your rights. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) You have to do it. Whether we like it or not, whether it`s something we want to do or not and that`s what our country has to do. I mean, as an example around, Iran, the way they have been treating us with all of this horrible, this deal is one of the worst deals I`ve ever seen negotiated under any circumstances and we just take it. We have to stick up for ourselves as people and we have to stick up for our country when we`re being mistreated. Remember that. I have to go a little step further and say that fox has been extremely nice the last number of hours, actually. They`ve wanted me there and they said how about now. They called a few minutes ago. How about now, can you come over? I said hasn`t it started. We actually thought we would let them start and we wanted to be about 15 minutes into that hour so that by now they`re all tuned in. Look at the cameras like the Academy Awards. This is like the Academy Awards. This is the Academy Awards. We`re actually told we have more cameras than they do by quite a bit. So, that`s – (CHEERS) And you know what? That`s really an honor of our vets. They have been very nice. They wanted me to go and apologize. They did apologize. They could not have been – once this started, there was nothing I could do. I don`t know. And you know what? I don`t know. Is it for me, personally, a good thing, a bad thing? Will I get more votes? Will I get less votes? Nobody knows. Who the hell know? But it`s for our vets. You`re going to like it because we raised over $5 million in one day, over $5 million. (CHEERS) So, that`s not so bad. You know, my whole theme is “Make America Great Again”. And that`s what we`re going to do. And we wouldn`t have been here if it weren`t for our vets. And our vets are being mistreated. Illegal immigrants are being treated better in many cases than our vets. It`s not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore. Once this ball started rolling, we couldn`t stop it. You see the house is packed. And literally, this took place less than 24 hours. We had less than 24 hours to do this. I said I`m not going to do the debate out of respect for myself, I won`t do it, because it would just be wrong. I love Iowa. I`m here. We got to do something. I didn`t know we were going to raise $5 million. We actually raise close to $6 million to be totally honestly. But I have to say, a lot more to come. We set up a site, www.DonaldTrumpforvets.com. They raised almost $500,000 just today. I think this money is going to continue to pour in. We have some incredible, incredible people. I do want to say, I do want to call out some of the folks that gave a lot of the money. Ands then we`re going to have somebody come up to speak who is an incredible speaker, but much more importantly it`s the subject. Somebody, somebody that really, really understands what the best are going through. We have to talk about people that made a lot of money. And they wouldn`t have made a lot of money, they wouldn`t even be here if it weren`t for the vets and our great military, because the military, right, Phil, has a lot more guts than you do, is that right? We have different kind of guts, right? So, Carl Icahn gave $500,000. One quick phone call, with $500,000. (APPLAUSE) Richard LeFrak, a great builder in New York, gave $100,000. (APPLAUSE) Donald Trump, another great builder in New York, now a politician – I can`t stand this. A politician? I don`t want to be called a politician. All talk, no action. I refuse to be called a politician. Donald Trump gave $1 million, OK? (APPLAUSE) The Fisher family of New York gave $75,000. (APPLAUSE) Howard Lowenberg (ph), a great fan and friend of our family, $100,000. (APPLAUSE) A very, very rich man in New York, a very good friend of mine, a very good person. He wants to be anonymous. All his life he was out there. I said could you give me a million bucks. He said tell me. I said it`s for the vets. He said you got it. Is that good, right? (APPLAUSE) He wanted to be – he wanted to be anonymous. He`s changed. You know who I`m talking about. Two years ago – (CHANTING) TRUMP: It really is too crazy. I tell the story, I love protests. I love protests at my rallies. Here, this is a beautiful place. We have thousands of people outside that weren`t as good as real estate. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. We set up cameras, we set up screens. We have everything. But I will tell you, you look at that. I love the protesters in the big arenas because the cameras never move. They`re always on my face. I say to my wife, Melania, honey, stand up. She has to suffer through it. Seriously suffered through this. Now, I go home and it`s always broadcast. You know, they can never like, the other politicians, nobody cares, nobody covering them. No cameras. Look at this. It`s like crazy. But I`d say, how did I do? She said, you were great. Were there many people there? I said what do you mean, it was 21,000. It was in Mavericks Arena, it was, I remember, in Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, we had 35,000 people. We get the biggest crowds by far. Much bigger than Bernie, although I have to say he is second. No other Republican. But we get the biggest crowds. She`ll say they never show the crowd. I said, what do you mean they never show the crowd? I realize they never turn the camera. I always say, you know, I figured maybe they are fixed, these are new cameras they can`t turn. The only way you find out that they`re not fixed, they`re like pretzels the way they turn them, is when you have a protester. You can have protesters up in top and they are turned around sideways. They turn. But they don`t want to show the crowd. It`s one of those things. So, we have a rich man from New York, a good guy who has become a little reclusive, obviously, $1 million. He`s a great guy. (APPLAUSE) We have another unbelievable man, Ike Perlmutter from Marvel. He did such an unbelievable job. One of the great, great men of our country in terms of business and talent. He`s giving Ike and Laurie Perlmutter, $1 million. (APPLAUSE) J.J. Cafaro from Florida and from Cleveland, he`s man who made a lot of money in Cleveland, does a good job and a fantastic man, $50,000. J.J., thank you. (APPLAUSE) Another great friend of mine, one of the most brilliant men you`ll ever meet, a phenomenal world class poker player, you wouldn`t even know it. He doesn`t do that for a living. He makes money for a living in every way. You cannot make a deal with this guy and come out on top. It`s impossible. In fact, I`m thinking about him for China. How about him negotiating with China, OK? (APPLAUSE) China, this year in trade will make over $500 billion in terms of our trade deficit, $500 billion. That`s no partnership. I`m a free trader. But we have to use our head. And we use political hacks to negotiate with the Chinese, and they have the smartest people. I deal with them all the time. I love the Chinese. They buy my apartments to millions. I have the largest bank in the world from China in one of my buildings. I love them. I`m not blaming the Chinese. I`m not angry at them. I`m angry at our politicians because we have people that are incompetent running our country. Why should we be losing in trade deficits $500 billion a year? So, it`s not going to happen. So, if I took a guy like this, put him this charge. His wife is so incredible. Would you both come up? Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, come on up. Come up. Come up. (APPLAUSE) He`s never had anything – it`s like everything he touches turns to gold. Whatever deal he goes into, he bought a piece of land in Las Vegas, spent $110 million. He sold it a few years later and made plenty of money in between for $1.3 billion, right? Just about? One point three. I think he says. Every single – so when he gives a million it`s like ten cents. But him, very important. Phil Ruffin, just say a couple of words. (APPLAUSE) PHIL RUFFIN, BUSINESSMAN: Thank you. I`d like to introduce my wife, Alexandra. Donald and I have been friends for some 18 years and business partners and about two years ago I said, Donald, if you ever run for president, I will give you a million dollars. Well, he ran. I gave him a million dollars. He sent it back. (APPLAUSE) He said, I can`t take your money. I couldn`t believe it. In any case, he`s a great man. I`m very happy. My wife and I will donate $1 million to your charity. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: He actually – he actually sent me a million dollars. He said there`s 10 or 20 more of them if you want it, if you need it. I just can`t stand it. You know I`m self-funding my own campaign, right? (APPLAUSE) But all my life, I made money. I made money. I`ve always been good making money. I think I have great imagination, but I made money. All my life, I did well. And my father always said, everything he touches turns to gold. That`s why I use that same expression on him because there`s a guy, believe me, a fantastic guy. But he always said, everything my boy touches turns to gold. What happens is I turn all this money down. They`re calling and calling. They want to give me money because being number one, they all want the control you. They want to give you money and now they call you. Remember I gave you $5 million. I tell the story about the Ford plant, about the Nabisco plant. So, what happens is all my life and I`m turning down millions. I was in Iowa in a different location. We had 4,000 people. I went to those people, I said listen, I don`t feel good about turning down money, because my whole life I`d been greedy, greedy, greedy. I grabbed all the money I could get. Now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I want to be greedy for the United States. (APPLAUSE) It`s true. But I`ve always feel guilty, I`m in this beautiful place and the crowd is lovely. We have the most incredible people in this country, in Iowa, but in this country, it`s like a movement going on. The cover of “Time Magazine” this week is a whole thing. It`s a cover story. In fact, there it is. Hold that up. They have the back of my head, they have the back of my head with the massive crowd in front of me and they`re cover the story. I said, I didn`t know they were doing the story. I said I didn`t know they were doing the story. And it`s a cover of “Time”, they`re talking about a movement. It is actually a movement. But what`s happening is I said to the crowd, let me ask you this one thing, supposing – and I promise you I won`t be influence influenced. Could I take all this money? Because I`m turning away so much money, stand up, please, could I take all this money? And everybody went crazy, no, no. It was only one guy and he was in the back corner of the room. He was a crooked looking guy. He was the only guy. He looked like such a crook. And he said it was OK to take it. And I look at that guy and I said, I don`t want anything to do with that. He`s the only guy. So, I feel a little bit – I feel a little bit foolish not taking the money. But, you know, you`re looking at guy like Jeb Bush – he`s taking a hundred – low energy, he`s taking a hundred and twenty – extremely low. I shouldn`t say, he`s debating right now. Maybe he`s doing great. He`s probably looking for me. He`s saying, has anyone seen Trump? Why – where`s Trump? Where is he? (APPLAUSE) Jeb – he`s taken $128 million. People that I know, killers. Killers, like him, killers. They put up $5 million, $2 million, $8 million. They`re lobbyists, special interests, they`re not doing that for their health. And whenever we have a problem, you know, a lot of times, I said the other day, because I know most of the lobbyists, I mean, I`ve used them. I was on the other side. Seven months ago, I was on the other side. I was a big giver. But I know these people and I said, believe me, when they put in $6 million, $5 million, $1 million, they`re not just doing it. They want something for it. When you see these horrible deals that are being made, and they are horrible, the politicians aren`t that stupid. You think they`re horrible. You say how is it possible that Iran just got $150 billion from this country in one of the dumbest deals ever? And they just went out, and the first purchase is 114 Airbus jets, not Boeing jets. And then we have from France and from other countries in Europe, and think of it, think of it, and then they go to Russia, they`re buying missiles. And somebody said – ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s front-runner speaking tonight in Des Moines, Iowa, and turning into his standard stump speech. He`s speaking here tonight just a couple of miles away from where the rest of the Republican field has been holding the last Republican candidates debate before the Iowa caucuses which are in four days. Here`s what I want to say about what`s going on here. We can – goodbye. It`s OK. Good-bye, Mr. Trump. Good-bye. That felt great. I`m actually right now with my mind, I`m willing you that power at home. Disappear. Poof. It`s like a mute button for your mind. All right. Here`s what`s going on, and I think this is worth understanding. Here`s why all the other Republican candidates right this weekend are at their last debate before Iowa and Donald Trump is counter programming and having his own event in the same town starting at the same time competing for the same attention. This is what is going on here. Do you remember last summer when Donald Trump was fairly new candidate on the campaign trail? He had shocked everybody basically by racing to the top of the polls as soon as he announced his campaign for president, right? And it was just, it was a few weeks into his new frontrunner status last summer, when he said something absolutely terrible about an American hero who spent five years being tortured and imprisoned in North Vietnam as a prisoner of war and who behaved with such heroism and patriotism and bravery under those circumstances that even people who cannot stand him as a politician rightfully honor his service in the almost unimaginable extraordinarily lengths that he went to to serve his country. This is what Donald Trump said about him just a couple of weeks after becoming the Republican frontrunner for president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I supported him for president. I raised a million dollars for him. I supported him. He lost. He let us down. He lost. I never liked him much after that because I don`t like loser. But, Frank, let me get to it. FRANK LUNTZ: He`s a war hero. TRUMP: He`s not a war hero. He`s a war hero – LUNTZ: Five and a half years as – TRUMP: He`s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren`t captured, OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' He`s not war hero. I like people who weren`t captured. That was last summer. Never an apology for that. But, Donald Trump, at the time he said that, he was the new front-runner for the presidential nomination. People were up in arms about this guy who never served a day in the military, saying John McCain, five years a prisoner of war was not a hero of war. In any normal for any normal candidate, that would not be fatal political error, that would be like a fatal public image error. I mean, that`s the kind of thing you say and you shock people and offend people so much by it that you`re sort of never heard from again, right? With Donald Trump, it didn`t work out that way. One of the small side bar stories that happened at the same time, which should have been our first inkling that things weren`t going to work out as normal with Donald Trump was that there was this weird sort of unexpected statement support for Mr. Trump in what he said about John McCain. It was a further attack on John McCain and it came from something called Veterans for a Strong America. They put a statement at a time. Quote, “This feuding between Mr. Trump and Senator McCain has nothing to do with Mr. Trump`s high regard for the military or veterans as a whole. Mr. Trump is a supporter of the U.S. military and of America`s veterans. It`s well-known that when Mr. Trump attack by a detractor, he swings back. As veterans, we do not hide behind military service to deflect criticism and when Senator McCain attacked Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump hit back.” It`s like, yes, McCain got what`s coming to him. Donald Trump was right to call him not a war hero. Take it from us. We`re veterans. It wasn`t the biggest story around that time but it was this interesting side bar. This statement from a group, what do they call him, Veterans for a Strong America. Side bar at the time. It ended up becoming a few weeks later when things were really picking up steam for Mr. Trump`s candidacy. In “The New York Times” scooped some of the juiciest quotes from a new, rather lurid biography about Mr. Trump. Among the most stomach-churning quotes and revelations in that book as described by “The New York Times” were quotes by Mr. Trump characterizing his own time at a military themed prep school when he was a teenager, characterizing that time at prep school as being equivalent to him having served in the military. Here`s how that article in “The New York Times” stated it on September 8. This is the start of the article. Quote, “Donald J. Trump, who received draft deferments throughout much of the Vietnam War told the author of an upcoming biography that he nevertheless, quote, `always felt I was always in the military` because of his education at a military themed boarding school.” “Despite sitting out the Vietnam War because of deferments followed by a high draft lottery number, Mr. Trump says he endured the rigors of military life.” Again quote Mr. Trump, “My number was so incredible. It was a very high draft number. Anyway, so I never had to do that, but I felt I was in the military in the true sense because I dealt with those people.” And by those people he means the other people he went to prep school with who were not the military but who did wear fancy outfits that made them look like majorettes. Those revelations, embarrassing, those embarrassing revelations and quotes, they were published by “The New York Times” September 8th. That same day, September 8th, Mr. Trump decided that he was suddenly feeling a little shy about showing up to the next Republican presidential primary debate. That same day that “The New York Times” published the quotes about him not being in military but thinking he was, that same day, Donald Trump wrote to CNN and demanded if they wanted him to participate in the next debate, they would have to pay him $5 million to do so. He also insisted that all profits be donated to veterans organizations – a list of which he would provide to CNN. And that was outrageous and strange and weird, but it did – because it was so weird, it kind of pushed the story about him at the military prep school thinking he was in the real military sort of pushed that out of the headlines for a day. Ultimately, I should tell you, we don`t have any indication that Mr. Trump ever bothered to send the list of veterans organizations to CNN nor did CNN ever pay him $5 million, as what, a booking fee for him participating in the debate. Ultimately, Mr. Trump decided to show up any way. But this is really it got weird. I think this is what explains what happened tonight because the night before that CNN debate in September, when Donald Trump suddenly discovered this newfound ardor for veterans causes after being caught out in his embarrassing effort to make it seem like he might be a veteran when he wasn`t, Donald Trump, the night before that debate, did a fund-raiser, and doing a fund-raiser is normal for any other presidential candidate but not normal for him, right? Remember, he`s not doing fundraisers. He`s self-funding his campaign. He said he`s not taking donations. No fundraisers. But Donald Trump went to the USS Iowa, to a decommissioned battleship in San Diego, he stood right into the guns and he did a fund- raiser – not for himself but for Veterans for a Strong America. That random thing which nobody had ever heard of before but which put out statement after he attacks John McCain saying John McCain deserved it and they Veterans for a Strong America, they were on Donald Trump`s side for picking on the POW as not being a real war hero. It was such a strange night. It`s the night before that debate. He`s demanding that the proceeds of the debates, like the advertising revenue, go to veterans, although he never follows through to even try to make it happen. He gets up there on a battleship. He does a presidential candidate fundraiser for this previously totally unknown group with the tough guy veterans name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Boy, oh, boy. I didn`t expect that. You know, Joel and the group called and said would you come over and speak. I`m here for a certain reason. It`s called tomorrow night. I got here and they ask a couple of days ago would it be possible to say a few words – an endorsement from your group with so many veterans, hundreds of thousands of veterans. I really appreciate that. I did not expect it. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Your group with so many veterans, hundreds of thousands of veterans. Veterans for a Strong America is not a group made up of hundreds of thousands of veterans. In fact, Veterans for a Strong America does not appear to have any members other than Joel who you just heard Mr. Trump refer to in a speech. As best as we can tell, he`s it. They are not a membership organization. There`s no real way to join them. They don`t have hundreds of thousands of anything. After we were first to report on the weirdness of this Donald Trump supposed veterans fund-raiser in September, it quickly emerged that the IRS revoked this group`s nonprofit status last year because they hadn`t filed tax returns in three years. This is actually a nice development in the story since. The group Veterans for a Strong America has since dissolved themselves as an organization. They recently reestablished themselves as an organization but with a slightly different name. They`re are no longer Veterans for a Strong America. They are now Vets for a Strong America. And on their certificate of incorporation which we dug up, you can see right there on their official documents, quote, “Checked off the corporation will not have members.” But at the time Donald Trump did this event for them, you couldn`t join them. Not a membership organization. Their latest FEC filing said they had $30 in the bank, they had approximately $300 in debts and obligations, which appeared mostly to be owed to another group that was just this one guy, Joel. So, here`s this technically defunct one man organization that Donald Trump, Republican presidential front-runner is doing a giant battleship fund- raiser for. It was so weird. We bugged the Trump campaign about it for days, trying to figure out what happened there. What was, where was, money, where`s the money – the Trump campaign ultimately gave us a statement about the event and what it accomplished. They told us this, quote, “Mr. Trump and the campaign had no knowledge of any issues associated with the group or their chairman Joel Arends. Nor does this campaign know what the group intends to do with the money raised that night.” We asked them specifically, do you know how much money you raised that night? The campaign said, “No. Please ask Veterans for a Strong America.” We asked them further, well, did veterans tell you what they would use the money for once you give them the money? Answer for the Trump campaign, “no”. So, they had no idea who this guy was or what the organization was. The candidate said they had hundreds of thousands of members. They actually have zero members. They have no idea how much money they raised, they have no idea what the money was used for and arguably because the group had its nonprofit status revoked by the IRS, it was arguably illegal for Donald Trump to raise money for that group in that way in California in September on the eve of that debate. So, that`s what is going on here. Once again, we have Donald Trump, still the Republican presidential front-runner, and lo these months, and lo these months later, he apparently feels like he wants to squirrel out of the debate again. For whatever reason, he doesn`t want to be with the other Republican candidates this year, four days before Iowa. But just like the last time he tried to squirrel out, this time he`s also playing the veterans card as his way to do it as if him skipping this debate is somehow noble and helps veterans. Mr. Trump`s event tonight at Drake University in Des Moines was built as a special event to benefit veterans organizations, the largest organization of our current generations of veterans, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. The founder and CEO Paul Rieckhoff put out this tweet yesterday as soon as the news emerged. Quote, “If offered, IAVA will decline donations from Trump`s events. We need strong policies from candidates not to be used for political stunts.” We`re still not sure where any money raised tonight by Mr. Trump is actually going to go. Let alone how much money he`s going to raise. Today, his campaign did launch this website, VeteransForVets.com, which generally asks for donations, quote, ” to support our veterans.” Where is that money going go that`s donated through that website? All we know is that it`s going to the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Who knows? Maybe the Donald J. Trump Foundation will turn it around and all donations will go directly to veterans needs as it says very vaguely on that website. But if you`re trying to figure out what`s going on here, just consider this: A, Donald Trump has done this before. B, the first time he did something like this, we have no idea where the money went. And C, DonaldTrumpforVets.com was registered as a website this morning. It was registered in the cheapest possible way. That website URL expires in exactly one year. It expires one year from today, at which point Mr. Trump or President Trump will get to decide whether he wants to renew that website and keep playing this particular trick or whether he let it fade away. Meanwhile, all the real veterans organizations will keep slogging away day after day doing really hard work that needs to be done, needing money for that cause. And they`ll keep doing it whether or not anybody is using them as a political stunt on any one particular day. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: But once this started, it`s for our vets there`s nothing I could do. I don`t know. You know what? I don`t know. Is it for me personally a good thing, a bad thing? Will I get more votes, will I get less votes? Nobody knows. Who the hell knows? But it`s for our vets. You`re going to like it because we raised over $5 million in one day. So, $5 million. So, that`s not so bad. You know, my whole theme is “Make America Great Again”. That`s what we`re going to do. And we wouldn`t have even been here if it weren`t for our vets. And our vets are being mistreated. Illegal immigrants are treated better in many cases than our vets and it`s not going to happen any more. It`s not going to happen any more. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump speaking tonight hosting an event as a result of his manufactured spat with FOX News. Instead of doing the last debate before Iowa, he`s doing this event that he says will benefit veterans groups, although we don`t really know what he means by that. One of the groups has come out and said they won`t take money from this event if offered is Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Joining us now is Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of IAVA. In some ways, even if candidates are being craven and exploitative in their treatment of veterans, does it help – does it create a better climate for you guys in terms of raising awareness and getting support that somebody`s talking about vets at all? RIECKHOFF: It doesn`t necessarily create a better climate, but I think it creates an opportunity. I`m here talking to you tonight, right? And we wouldn`t be if this wasn`t happening. So, in some ways, thank you, Donald Trump. But it`s creating a toxic environment. I mean, part of you answer is early is yes we`ve gotten support, we`ve also gotten ferocious, nasty, nasty attacks. ', 'MADDOW:', ' From when we said we`re not going to take his money. (CROSSTALK) RIECKHOFF: We`re not endorsing anyone. We`re not taking a partisan position. We wouldn`t take money from Bernie Sanders either. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right. RIECKHOFF: And I go on your show, I go on FOX. We`re a nonpartisan organization. Our members are very diverse. We said we`re not going to take money and we`re going to stay out of that. And they have descended on us on Twitter, on our phones, jamming up our hotline that actually serves veterrns who are in crisis. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Really? RIECKHOFF: And it`s a nasty tone. That`s actually a plea to him. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is it an organized thing? Or it just – who is it? RIECKHOFF: I don`t know if it`s organized or not. But you can see it on Twitter. You know, it`s on our email account. And we`ve got social workers who take calls from veterans in crisis and their phone lines are being hit by these folks. So, I hope that he can turn them in a different direction. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Because these are Trump supporters? RIECKHOFF: Yes. All we did was say we`re not going to take your money. And most veterans groups will not take their money. The VFW doesn`t seem to be taking their money, the American Legion. We`ve said it publicly and a lot of vets groups are saying it privately and we thought it was important to say keep it out of this. And if folks want to donate, they don`t have to do it through a political campaign. They can donate to us or any other top veterans groups just by finding us online. But, take a bigger step back. There are 22 million veterans in this country, 22 million. They are a diverse, strong, influential voting group. And they`re jump off. So, I think they are watching and they`re watching both parties. Many are independent minded, our members in particular that are younger are very independent-minded. So, o maybe everybody will now start to play them. Maybe they will talk to us about specifics, they will get down to brass tacks, they`ll talk about what they`re going to do in the V.A., and maybe now moderators will ask them questions about it. And that can be a good thing in America in the end. ', 'MADDOW:', ' If there is an organized group of people or even a disorganized group of people going after IAVA on this, you can give them my number. RIECKHOFF: Yes. We`re pretty organize and we`re used to being attacked. So, we can handle it, but I hope they send it in directional. ', 'MADDOW:', ' It makes me mad. Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of IAVA, I`m mad on your behalf. Thank you my friend. RIECKHOFF: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Good to see you. We`ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Are you fully staffed up in terms of school nurses, for example, in terms of special ed? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are – we are not. We are blessed enough to have a health navigator that allows our parents to make connections with the community, but we do not have a school nurse. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You do not have a school nurse? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We do not. None of our schools do. Usually that responsibility falls on our secretaries. I give medications. We`re trained to do certain things. Again, we make do with the staff that we have who are devoted with serving our children. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Flint community schools do not have nurses right now? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We do not. We have one in our district level. ', 'MADDOW:', ' One for all the schools? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, ma`am. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One for the entire district, 6,000 kids, nine elementary schools, one nurse total in a community where all the kids in town need extra support and medical monitoring and attention because they were all just exposed to lead poisoned tap water. That was a moments in Flint last night at our town hall where I could sort feel the recoil, feel the whiplash from all of those in the room who weren`t from Flint who didn`t know that and everybody in the room knew that. It was just remarkable. Today, though, there is some news that more school nurses may be coming to Flint. Today, the Michigan legislature approved $28 million to help address Flint`s water crisis and they did designate several thousand dollars of that money to hire nine school nurses for Flint`s public schools. So, there`s that and may it come to pass. But there`s also some late breaking news about how the state of Michigan responded to this disaster while it was under way and in the throes of it. This has just been reported late today. It`s jaw-dropping story. It`s something that happened basically a year ago. Flint residents were still being told that the water was perfectly safe. January 21st of last year, state officials came to Flint city hall to assure the people at a public meeting that they were totally on top of any problems with Flint`s water. Flint residents who came to that meeting and shouted complaints at state officials. They held up jugs of brown water. One of the treatment experts from the Snyder administration, told the people of Flint, told people in that room that they should, quote, “hang in there”. Flint residents were still being told at this time that it was fine for them to drink this water. But what those Snyder administration officials did not say at that town meeting was that two weeks earlier, the state government had started shipping bottled water to the state office building in Flint. The Snyder administration had started shipping coolers of purified water to the state workers at the state office building in Flint so at least they wouldn`t have to drink the tap water. “The Detroit Free Press” first reported this day based on state government e-mails released by the liberal group Progress Michigan. Quote, “DTMB, which stands for the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, that`s a state agency that oversees state office buildings, DTMB is in the process of providing a water cooler on each occupied floor position near the water fountain so you can choice which water to drink. The coolers will arrive today and will be provided as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements.” January of last year, the Rick Snyder administration all last year was telling the people of Flint that everything was fine, everything was under control, there was no danger from their tap water, but the people who actually worked for the Snyder administration at the state office building in Flint, they were getting sent pure clean water to drink. Everybody else in Flint hang in there. Amazing. If you lived in Flint, would you trust the state government to fix the problem there now, right, to tell you when it`s safe to give your child a glass of water? The folks I met in Flint at this town hall yesterday were incredibly warm, incredibly open-hearted, but they were also very, very suspicious of anybody telling them that things were OK, that they ought to relax. And the more you learn about what they have been through over these past two years when they`ve screaming bloody murder and they`ve been told everything was fine when it was not, and in some cases being told that by people who knew it was not fine, it is easy to see why they are so suspicious. It doesn`t count as paranoia, it doesn`t count as conspiracy when you live through what they have lived there. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence. ']\n",

(END VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER: “An American Disaster: The Crisis in Flint.” This is an MSNBC town hall, from the Holmes STEM Academy, here now Rachel Maddow. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Welcome to Flint, Michigan. Welcome. Thank you to everybody in this room for being here. It`s an honor to be here among you today after covering this story for so long. I want to thank you at home for being with us tonight. We are here tonight for this special town hall because a disaster of national proportions has hit this city. And even though the country has now woken up to that disaster, we`re here tonight to report what I think is fairly shocking news that the problem here is not actually being fixed. This has been a story about Flint, a story about Michigan so far, but what it`s going to take to fix it here is national. It`s American. It`s big. (APPLAUSE) And I want to show you something. This is at the heart of what went wrong, and frankly, what still is wrong. The reason I`m using a cloth to hold this is because this is lead. This is lead pipe from Flint, and a lot of people in Flint have lead pipe like this going from the water main that runs down the street into their homes. All right? Lead pipe. This, this is the kind of galvanized pipe that a lot of people have inside their homes. This specific piece of galvanized pipe was cut out of a wall in a house in Flint by a master plumber who lives in that house who grew up in that house and who cut out this piece of it to show us what this American disaster looks like up close, literally from inside the pipes. When the state of Michigan made the inexplicable decision to send untreated corrosive river water through the pipes in the city, that decision basically wrecked the pipes. It started a corrosion process that sent toxic lead into the water, into people`s homes, through the faucets and into the bodies of moms and dads and old people and little kids in Flint. And that corrosive water source has been switched. It`s been switched back. But damage is done. Damage is done to the pipes, to all of them. That is why you still cannot drink the water here. Not because the water source is still bad. They switched it back to the good one. It`s because the pipes have been hurt by the 18 months of bad water that flowed through them. And so, we need to talk about how to help the kids who have been exposed to this toxic stuff in this town and we are going to do that tonight with the people who you want to hear from on that subject. (APPLAUSE) But we also need to have a little bit of a come to Jesus, a little bit of a reality check about the fact that so far, no one is even starting to fix what the problem still is here. (APPLAUSE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m just trying to get my head around what it`s going to take to fix this problem in Flint. HAROLD HARRINGTON, MASTER PLUMBER BASED IN FLINT: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you think that service lines are going to be need to be replaced all around the city in order to make those homes safe? HARRINGTON: If you want to make them safe, yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let`s say this service line between here and the house is made of lead. And part of fixing this problem in Flint is replacing that service line. How big a job is that? HARRINGTON: It`s a big job if you – you know, defending where it is, you have to excavate it all the way into the house and remove the lead and run a new line. ', 'MADDOW:', ' How expensive of a job would that be? HARRINGTON: For something like this, probably three to five grand to get the new line in there. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Wow. HARRINGTON: But that`s not counting the damage that`s in the house. ', 'MADDOW:', ' If you were going to come in as a master plumber, get hired to replace the plumbing in a typical house like this – can you give me just a ballpark about the dollar amount that would cost? HARRINGTON: Single-story, without an upstairs, roughly $4,000. Just for inside the house. Another thousand for the water heater. You know, the line coming into the house, $3,000 to $4,000. You`re over $10,000. These houses, just like my house – I mean, my house isn`t worth $10,000. The plumbing`s going to cost more than you could sell your house for. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And we`re talking about 30,000 houses in the city of Flint. Roughly. HARRINGTON: Roughly. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Plus, every business, every – HARRINGTON: Every school. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Every school building. HARRINGTON: Every hospital. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Every hospital. Everything. Let`s say the will was there. Let`s say the governor or whoever came in and said, go, we are going to take care of these service lines and we`re going to do it as fast as humanly possible. How – how many people could you imagine mobilizing to do that? Like, how long would it take to get a significant number of plumbers here doing that work and doing it fast? HARRINGTON: If we needed people here next week, I could get 200 people here in a couple days. I could have a thousand people here in a couple weeks. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You could have a thousand plumbers on the ground in flinlt in a couple weeks? HARRINGTON: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' If somebody said go? HARRINGTON: If somebody said go. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Now, it`s a matter of figuring out if somebody is ever going to say go. There was an e-mail – the governor`s e-mails were all released and something and somebody told him this past summer, listen, if we`re going to replace all these lead service lines in Flint, that`s something that will take 15 years – HARRINGTON: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' – to do it. HARRINGTON: It will take 15 years the way they`re going about it right now. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. HARRINGTON: But we could have, like I said, 1,000 operators, 1,000 plumbers, 1,000 cement finishers, 1,000 laborers, I mean, we could start hitting these right now. If there`s only 20,000 of them, we could have it done in a lot less than 15 years. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Like how much time? HARRINGTON: Well, depending on how much equipment, we get as much equipment as we can get in here, we could do a street a week I`m sure. You know? Not 15 years. (END VIDEOTAPE) (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Joining us now, here at our town hall, is Flint`s mayor, Karen Weaver. Also Virginia Tech environmental engineering professor Marc Edwards, who collected hundreds of water samples showing elevated lead levels here in Flint, really blew this whole scandal wide open. Also, Martin Kaufman, professor at the University of Michigan. He`s working to map all of Flint`s pipes and those service lines. Mayor Weaver, professors, thank you for being here. I really appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) Mayor, I know you were at a press conference today with Governor Snyder. He was really pressed on this issue of mow how come no pipes were getting replaced yet, why that work hasn`t started. He basically said that`s a job for the long haul, no reason to think about doing anything like that any time soon. How does that sit with you? MAYOR KAREN WEAVER (D), FLINT, MICHIGAN: It doesn`t sit very well with me. We need that to happen right now. We know we need the lead service lines replaced immediately. And that`s what – you know, the questions that the reporters were asking were the same questions we have. When is it going to start? ', 'MADDOW:', ' Professor Edwards, you`ve been absolutely key to the country – the Flint itself and now the country understanding what happened here. You have gone from the state, you know, ridiculing you and trying to box you out to now putting you on their task forces. I know you`re going go be overseeing lead testing here in Flint. WEAVER: That`s right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you feel like as an expert in this field, do you feel like you know how much work needs to be done on Flint`s pipes in order to make this city safe? MARC EDWARDS, VIRGINIA TECH: Yes, there`s actually three different phases of work that has to be done. First, we have to restore this coating to the pipe which is being done through optimized corrosion control. We have to determine that the water, if and when it`s safe to drink again through a federally approved lead and copper sampling which hasn`t been done, unfortunately, in Flint, for a long time. And longer term in Flint, not just in Flint, but around the U.S., we have to figure out a way to get these pipes replaced. And what we`re struggling with right now is there`s really no precedent for this kind of manmade disaster. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right. EDWARDS: And we don`t have a good roadmap to follow in terms of how to replace these pipes and do it right. And we could jump into this and actually do it wrong. Other cities have done it wrong and made the problem worse in the past. So, we have to – we have to work with the EPA – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Are there best practices out there about how to get corroded and, therefore, dangerous pipe out? EDWARDS: There are – ', 'MADDOW:', ' – replaced with good pipe? EDWARDS: There are absolutely. The hurdles we face, the records are so poor, not only in Flint but all around the U.S., we don`t know where these lead pipes are. The records we have are oftentimes wrong. So, simply identifying which homes have the lead pipes is kind of a monumental task. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Which brings us to Professor Kaufman who is working on the monumental task. We don`t know specifically where the lead pipes are in Flint but you`re trying to figure it out? EDWARDS: We`re trying to figure it out. We have an indicator on parcels in the city where the lead pipes are, also the hybrid pipes some of them have been changed out to lead and copper. We estimate, there are about 20,000 to 25,000 lead service lines in this city leading into homes. We`re going to need to get into people`s homes and do a test of their water line coming into the home with a key and a magnet. People can tell what type of service line that`s coming into the house, if it`s lead, it won`t be magnetic. It`s (INAUDIBLE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I see. So, people with a little bit of instruction can diagnose whether or not they have a lead line coming into their own home. They can tell you. KAUFMAN: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In terms of the urgency, I hear an echo of what Governor Snyder was saying today, the way you described this, Professor Edwards. In terms of this coating, this idea that running treated water now through these pipes is going to rehabilitate them a little bit. Do you have faith that`s the right next step? Is that happening? Do we know how long that takes? WEAVER: I don`t know that we know how long that takes. That`s what we`ve been waiting to see, how long will that take? The other problem is, you know, because we have been – our trust has been broken in the city of Flint. Because that`s happened – (APPLAUSE) WEAVER: – because that`s happened, if we don`t get new pipes, people aren`t going to trust that. And that`s a lot of the underlying issue. We`ve had broken trust. So, do we trust that that bio film is built up and water is safe, that the pipes are safe, not the water, but the pipes are safe? And that will always be in the back of the residents` minds. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Karen Weaver, Marc Edwards, Martin Kaufman, please stay with us. We`re going to take questions for you guys from the residents of Flint. I really appreciate you being here tonight and starting about this. I got to tell you, overall, that we`re excited to be here tonight to be meeting people of Flint. I want to thank the Holmes STEM Academy, the Huskies for hosting us. I should tell you, we`re in the gym – I`ve got to say the mascot. I should tell you that we asked Rick Snyder himself multiple times if he would please come tonight to this town hall and talk to the residents of Flint. He never said no. He never said anything. But I think that means he`s not coming. That`s OK, though. One of the things people I think nationally have gotten wrong about Flint in this crisis is that there`s a perception and sometimes dismissive tone nationwide that Flint is the kind of place where people don`t have a voice. That is wrong. (APPLAUSE) You guys on the ground here are why we are here. You are why we even knew this was happening. It has been Flint residents that have been calling out this crisis for what it is, for going on two years now. You guys have protested. You have dug into the documents. You have formed activist groups. You have organized water drives. You have organized blood test clinics. And one of the things I have learned covering this story is that Flint, Michigan, is often underestimated, but that Flint is fierce and nobody would know about this if it weren`t for you. (APPLAUSE) So that`s why we`re here. That`s why we`re here. And we`ll be right back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can`t bathe, can`t drink, can`t eat. We`re paying for water, contaminated water that we can`t even use and that`s a travesty. Then, on top of that, they`re not talking about putting lines in. They`re talking about doing a study. They`ve been studying for two years. They shouldn`t have to study anymore. Come in, lines, put in-home filters in. I mean, all the filters they bought putting on sinks they could have been paid $1,000 to put in-home filters in until they can change the infrastructure. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LESTER HOLT, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Now to the growing outrage over the toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The mayor says it could cost as much as $1.5 billion to fix the lead-contaminated water system. But NBC`s Stephanie Gosk has found so far none of the pipes are actually being replaced. STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The plumbers in Flint say they are ready. HARRINGTON: We got guys available. If I need 200 guys next week, I can get them. GOSK: But the plumbers in Flint haven`t gotten the call. NBC News has learned from both city water officials and the plumber`s union that there are currently no lead pipes being replaced. And the plumbers tell us they haven`t done any work since the governor`s October announcement that the water wasn`t safe. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Just some of the excellent reporting that`s been done in Flint by a bunch of national news organizations including NBC News, including specifically by reporter Stephanie Gosk who`s here with us tonight. Stephanie, it`s great to have you here. We also got our panel of experts and local leaders here and a room full of people from Flint who we want to hear from tonight. I want to start actually with that master plumber who we were just speaking to, with Harold Harrington. Harold, first of all, thank you for your – stand up for a second – thank you for your hospitality walking around, showing us your town and what you know about this as a plumber. Do you have a question for these guys in terms of what needs to happen next? HARRINGTON: Yes, I do. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Go ahead. HARRINGTON: Yes, my question`s for Professor Edwards. The problem with the treatment of the Flint River, they didn`t correct the corrosiveness, and I think it was 19 times more corrosive than it should have been if it was treated properly. It was 19 times more corrosive than it should have been. So the piping, you know, it ate the corrosive layer off the lead, but there`s also a lot of galvanized in people`s homes in Flint that has corroded over the years coming through that lead pipe – and from what I`ve read, it collects lead over the years. EDWARDS: Yes. HARRINGTON: Now, did that corrosive water also expose all that lead in the galvanized pipes that are in people`s homes? EDWARDS: So, the corrosive water actually ate up every metallic pipe in the system. The only pipe material that was immune is plastic. So the damage that was done from the lack of corrosion inhibiter affected all the metal pipes. That damage cannot be undone. But the new coating with the phosphate is being formed as we speak and, in fact, probably it`s largely reformed already. The issue really is we really have to test that water before – we want to err on the side of caution before we tell anyone to even think about drinking it at this point. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is there any scientific basis for expecting how long that`s going to take? EDWARDS: In our laboratory under normal circumstances, it takes anywhere from four weeks to six weeks to get to a level where you can meet the federal standard. And, everyone, you know, acknowledges the federal standard is kind of weak, but it could very well – it`d be 50/50 if the legitimate lead and copper sampling was done today whether Flint would pass. But the water is much, much better than it was last August when we sampled, when we issued our warning, you know, there`s no way Flint water was meeting the federal standards. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let`s take another question here. Say your name. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Jill. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Go ahead, Jill. What`s your question? AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is actually informed by some of the conversations I`ve been having with activists in Detroit who have been making linkages on the work they`ve been doing against emergency management and their limited access to water in that city as well. It`s about in the meantime, and all the reliance on bottled water and what does that mean for environmental issues and also economically, who`s benefiting from the reliance on bottled water and what happens with all of this plastic that is being used in this city? (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Any of you want to take that on? EDWARDS: Sure. You know, the environmental costs of bottled water and plastic is nothing compared to protecting children and pregnant mothers from the ravages of lead. So, we have to be willing to pay that cost until we know that the water is meeting federal standards. So, keep using those filters, keep using the bottled water until you get the all clear. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is it sustainable for Flint to live on bottled water for much longer? AUDIENCE: No! WEAVER: We are looking at the recycling piece because we have to have that in place. We can`t have all of the plastic just around, so we are going to be doing something about recycling as well. But no, it`s not realistic, it`s not normal. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You can hear it in the room. We got a verdict in the room on that subject. KAUFMAN: And it creates a hardship on people because bottled water doesn`t have any pressure. So you can`t bathe in bottled water. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. Mayor Weaver, Professor Edwards, Professor Kaufman, thank you for contributing to this part of this town hall. One of the ways that people and politicians have tried to minimize what`s happened in Flint by saying it`s only a few dozen kids who are testing positive in terms of lead exposure. But it should be noted that your blood lead level is only a temporary snapshot, only shows up as having an elevated blood lead level for something like 28 days after you were exposed. The doctor who not only helped uncover that thousands of kids in Flint were being exposed to lead but who has since blown the whistle on people and politicians trying to minimize the problem by saying, “Oh, it`s only a few dozen kids who got positive lead tests right now,” that doctor is another one of the real heroes of this story and she`s one of the people who`s going to join us. (APPLAUSE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANITA WILLIAMS-HENDERSON, FLINT RESIDENT: I have to buy water all the time. I`m concerned with bathing even though they say it`s okay to bathe. I`m not really sure that`s true. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER RIVERA, PRESCHOOL TEACHER: All right, guys. What are we going to make? GOSK: Jennifer Rivera is a preschool teacher in Flint. She describes her 4-year-olds as low-income, high-risk. CHILDREN: Thank you for my family. RIVERA: Well, it breaks my heart because they already have a struggle. Everything is a struggle for them already. What do we do with this? GOSK: Now she watches closely every day for signs of lead poisoning. RIVERA: I`ve noticed the speech, the articulation, and I`ve noticed behaviors of anger. GOSK: Right now, Flint is getting a lot of attention. Right now these kids are getting a lot of attention. But this is the insidious part about lead exposure. The symptoms may not show in the weeks to come or even the months to come. It could take years. And every single one of these children will have to be tracked their entire childhoods. UINIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fifteen and – UNIDENTIFIED KID: Eighteen. GOSK: Education, good nutrition, a stable upbringing help lessen the effects of lead exposure. But those building blocks of childhood are also exactly what was lacking for so many in Flint before this ever happened. Do you have faith that the city officials and the state officials are going to be committed to this problem and are going to do what is needed to fix it and to help these kids? RIVERA: I do not at this time. GOSK: That trust is gone, isn`t it? RIVERA: Uh-huh, because they knew, in my opinion, and they let it happen. (END VIDEOTAPE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Welcome back to our town hall in Flint, Michigan – (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' – where the lead exposure for this town really isn`t measured in the few dozen positive lead tests we keep hearing about from state officials. The experts closest to this crisis say that the lead poisoning crisis here is actually measured in thousands of kids. Every kid in Flint who drank that water is now at some risk for long-term effects, but there are things we can do as a community and as a nation to help these kids. And apparently, the faster we act, the better. Joining us now is Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped expose the elevated blood lead levels in Flint`s children. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) You can hear the way that she is viewed in this town, the spontaneous standing ovation for Dr. Mona. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Welcome. The community appreciates you. DR. MONA HANNA-ATTISHA, PEDIATRICIAN: Lots of heroes. It took a village to save a village, so lots of hero. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Also want to bring in State Rep Sheldon Neeley who said he warned Governor Snyder about the water crisis in Flint a year ago. STATE REP. SHELDON NEELEY (D), MICHIGAN: A year ago. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I also want to bring in Anna Johnson, who`s the principal of this very school, Holmes STEM Academy, and who now like a lot of other leading educators here is confronting what the schools` role is going to be in doing right by Flint kids throughout their childhood. So, thank you all for being here, all leaders and heroes in the story in your own way. Dr. Mona, I want to start with you. You`re the person who first told not just Flint but told the world that Flint`s kids were exposed in such big numbers. HANNA-ATTISHA: Right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' What do you saw to Flint parents who are worried about their kids and kids` future? HANNA-ATTISHA: Right. So, we do what we do best as pediatricians. We provide reassurance. Not every kid is going to have every problem. So, we give them hope. Our community needs hope. They`re absolutely traumatized. (APPLAUSE) And there`s things that we can do right now. I feel we`re in a state of emergency because if we don`t act for these kids now, we will see those consequences in 10, 15, 20 years. So we need to provide a stable, loving home environments, we need to provide great parenting skills, we need to tell them love your kid, read to them, do everything you would do for them, for any kid at risk for developmental issues. Nutrition plays a tremendous role. We have no grocery stores in Flint. We have pre-existing access to nutrition. So, we need to bolster the kids` nutrition to help their brain development. We need to get them to their medical home, which is their primary care doctor, because the sooner I pick up a delay in the kid, the sooner I refer them to services, the better the outcomes. So, we need a whole-child approach. We need to wrap these kids around with every single resource so that we don`t see those consequences and that is our goal. We want to flip this story. We want to turn lemons into lemonade and give these kids what they need already. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Principal Johnson, the place that kids spend more time than anywhere other than with their families is at school. ANNA JOHNSON, HOLMES STEM ACADEMY PRINCIPAL: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let me ask you about the resources that you got now. I mean, how are Flint schools resourced right now? Do you have school nurses? Do you have good school nutrition programs already? AUDIENCE: No! ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you have stuff in place? Do you feel like your district really needs to be transformed in order to do what Dr. Mona`s talking about? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Say it. JOHNSON: Currently we need a lot of help. We are a cash-strapped district but we have resilient people. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we do. JOHNSON: We have a lot of people working very hard with the resources that we have but we know and we look at the number of students that we`re servicing, it will fall short and no one can tell us that our children aren`t worth it. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Are you fully staffed up in terms of school nurses, for example, in terms of special ed? JOHNSON: We are not. We are blessed enough to have a health navigator that allows our parents to make connections with the community but we do not have a school nurse. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You do not have a school nurse. JOHNSON: We do not. None of our schools do. Usually that responsibility falls on our secretaries. I give medications. We`re trained to do certain things. Again, we make do with the staff that we have who are devoted to serving our children. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Flint community schools do not have school nurses right now? JOHNSON: We do not. We have one in our district level. ', 'MADDOW:', ' One for all schools? JOHNSON: Yes, ma`am. HANNA-ATTISHA: Michigan ranks last in the nation in terms of the recommended ratio of students to school nurses. We`re the last in the entire nation. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, you`re talking about a suite of things that need to be done for Flint kids that should be done for all kids everywhere, right? HANNA-ATTISHA: Absolutely. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' But Flint kids because of what happened here, it especially needs to happen here, but it`s especially not happening here already. HANNA-ATTISHA: Right, and an emergent basis. It needs to happen now. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Representative, you know about how the state feels about Flint and you know what the state is capable of. And what they apparently aren`t capable of in terms of Flint. Do you have faith that the state will provide these kind of resources that we`re talking about here? This is very nuts and bolts stuff, not esoteric stuff. NEELEY: You know, our governor has been very disingenuous as he provided relief for this community, he`s been very late. We have a great contingent. Myself and State Representative Phil Phelps, and Senator Jim Ananich, we`ve been fighting on the state level. Money will be appropriated to those efforts, to prioritize school nurses and other resources for the Flint community schools. I made a request. Our current school district, we owe the state of Michigan $16 million. I asked the governor to forgive those dollars so they can re-appropriate those dollars for the onset of the kids they`re going to have to educate in the future. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' A lot of appetite in this room to talk about this issue with community leaders. We`re going to do that and hear from these guys right after this. We`ll be right back. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHARRON JOHNSON, FLINT RESIDENT: For me, I worry more so about the kids because you know how they are, they want to run, drink the water, but we`re scared to take showers. Cooking is a challenge when you want to wash your food and stuff like that. So, you have to make sure you have enough bottled water around and things like that. I`m telling you, it`s a challenge around the house. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Welcome back. We are in Flint, Michigan, for our special town hall on the water crisis here. We got a panel here of leaders including local pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha who really blew the whistle in terms of the blood lead levels in Flint`s kids. Also, Michigan State Representative Sheldon Neeley, and the principal of this school, Holmes STEM Academy, Principal Anna Johnson. We`re going to take some questions. Can I start with you? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Please stand up. Tell us what your name is. AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Lashana (ph). ', 'MADDOW:', ' OK. What`s your question? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good evening, everyone. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You can take that from me. There you go. AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is heavy. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You`ve got to hold it tight. There you go. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good evening, my name is Lashana and I`m here with my daughter, Sidney. She`s 13, but she`s still my baby. As the educator of early childhood, I teach pre-K, I am really concerned about my children in my classroom. I understand that during this time, their brain development is very critical. And simply put, I just want to know if the effects are irreversible and how can I and my co-workers, as we like to say, their school mamas, how can us as educators advocate and protect our children while we`re here? ', 'MADDOW:', ' Great question. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Oops, sorry. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Any of you want to respond to that? HANNA-ATTISHA: Sure. So, lead, the reason there`s no safe level of lead because it is irreversible neurotoxin. But there`s things that we can do to limit the impact of this exposure. Going to Head Start, being in preschool is one of those interventions that can actually lessen the impact and the life-long consequences. Those kind of things are the things that promote development. But educators need to be educated about what to expect, so to pick up on the signs of, oh, this is a social emotional problem that could be from this, this is kids not doing what they need to be doing. They`re going to need the resources to be able to manage those kids. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. Right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let`s take one other question here. What`s your name? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. I`m Ashwena (ph). As a pediatrician at Hurley, representing the pediatricians who work on this, I want to know about future funding going forward, trying to identify at-risk populations, particularly newborns, not a population we test for lead and we know they can be affected, so just talking about them. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Question, I mean, that`s an interesting question in terms of how much support you feel is coming. As a state representative, you may know some about what`s coming from the state, but as an educator and doctor, you guys may have your own horizons here. NEELEY: Well, the dollars have been allocated to start the emergency triage of this community, to resurrect it. But if the governor has been genuine in his approach, his budget is coming out within a month. We want to know how much money has been dedicated to this effort inside the city of Flint, guaranteed, instead of lip service. We want to make sure we get enough resources for this community to make sure we educate our children. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' We have another question on the subject of kids and supporting kids in Flint. Sure, right here. What`s your name? AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Andrea. I`m a transplant from Boston. I`m living with M.S. and I have a son who`s 32 years old living with high- functioning autism. I understand the importance of what you`re doing. Early intervention`s crucial, Head Start, you know, early childhood education in every public school is so important. My biggest fear is, how do we prepare? And this is true, and I lived it, I have enough paperwork to wallpaper a city. How do we prepare, best prepare parents? And I would call them my sisters and/or brothers because I`ve done this and lived this – as to what they`re going to need to face along the road ahead, the mazes of state agencies, education, everything that`s so underfunded? As well-intended as the people that the providers are, the bottom line is always the budget. That`s a big concern of mine. And one more, the adults. ', 'MADDOW:', ' The adults is a question we`ve had come up a lot that this is obviously something for whom the kids is a primary concern and you`re a kid doctor. But are there concerns, reasons, especially people dealing with chronic illnesses? And people dealing with broader family concerns on this? HANNA-ATTISHA: Yes. Lead impacts everybody, absolutely everybody. Adults, seniors, pets, everybody has been impacted this. In Flint, that`s a population of about 100,000 people who have been impacted. Everybody will present with different things and hopefully people will have no symptoms and no complications. But we need their resources to get the interventions in place for the entire exposed population. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. We`ve got a lot more still to come tonight. I want to tell you that the NAACP met with Mayor Weaver and Governor Snyder yesterday and released a set of priorities. NAACP priorities for tackling this crisis like hiring local young people to do door-to-door water distribution and paying them minimum wage. (APPLAUSE) NAACP want to get free home inspection to see how safe people`s homes are. But it`s interesting, the NAACP, in making up this list of priorities, they said their number one priority for addressing this crisis is repealing the emergency manager law that stripped local democracy from Flint. (APPLAUSE) They want democracy back as priority one in fixing this crisis. There is some support for that idea in this room. Hold that thought. We`ll be on that when we come, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MSNBC PRODUCER EMILY DREW: What would you like to say to the government? DORIAN GREEN, FLINT RESIDENT: State or federal? To the federal government, do what you can. We`ve need help for a long time, and I hate that it took a crisis of this magnitude for them to step in and do something about it. To the state government, it`s all your fault. Accept the responsibility. Step down and let somebody who`s capable of running the state do so. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SNYDER: Well, Steve, the way this really happened is the community made a decision that city and the county all wanted to switch away from Detroit`s water system. Actually, the city council of Flint voted, in fact, to move away from DWSD as a water source. That was ratified then by the emergency manager. It was a 7-1 vote of the city council to leave the Detroit water system. Government failed you. Federal, state, and local leaders by breaking the trust you placed in us. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Brief fact check. It is true that government failed the city of Flint, Michigan, but local leaders here in Flint were not actually at fault because local leaders were replaced in Flint by emergency managers who ran the city on their own say so and who reported only to the governor and not to the voters of this city. A state-appointed emergency manager signed the order to get ready for drinking water from Flint River. State-appointed emergency manager presided over the switch. That is how this happened. Is fixing that part of fixing this crisis? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. Back with us now, Flint mayor, Karen Weaver. She`s joined by Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and the Reverend Charles Williams, who`s president of the National Action Network of Michigan. Thank you, all, very much, for being here. I really appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) Mayor Weaver, let me start with you. It`s clear to me getting rid of the democratic process in Flint is part of how this happened. When I look at people from Flint holding jugs of dirty water, this is terrible, saying we have to reverse this, having nobody able to hear the complaints who could do anything about it, I realize, OK, there`s the breakdown. If democracy is restored in Flint, is that going to help solve this problem? WEAVER: Democracy needs to be restored in Flint. That`s what`s happened. That`s how we got here. We didn`t have a voice. It was taken. And when you`re elected, even under emergency manager, when you`re elected, you`re supposed to speak up and speak out on behalf of the people that got you. That didn`t happen in our case. (APPLAUSE) It didn`t happen in our case. And we need democracy. That`s how we are heard as a community, that`s how we`re heard as a voice. And it wasn`t in place for the citizens of Flint. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Reverend Williams, you`ve been such an activist, along with a lot of other people in Michigan, you`ve been one of the activists who`s really highlighted the dangers of the emergency manager law. Do you think the Flint crisis will change the emergency manager law and its politics and its viability here? REV. CHARLES WILLIAMS, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK OF MICHIGAN PRESIDENT: Well, you know, I was thinking about what I was going to stay on the way here, and I felt like Marshawn Lynch, all I got to say is Governor Snyder got to go. (APPLAUSE) WILLIAMS: One-point-two billion dollars of surplus money is sitting right in Lansing right now because Governor Snyder cut welfare, because Governor Snyder cut pensioners, because Governor Snyder gave $2 billion to his fat cat folks in Michigan, and you can`t find $1.2 billion to make sure pipes are going in the ground right now? The governor needs to dig those pipes immediately. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Senator Stabenow? SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW (D), MICHIGAN: Yes? ', 'MADDOW:', ' The federal government has stepped up in a lot of ways. Obviously, there were problems in terms of the EPA`s response. Federal government was not blameless here. But since the crisis has come to light, the federal government has been devoting a lot of resources to this. That`s on its face good. Is it also letting the state of Michigan off the hook? STABENOW: Well, first thing I would say, the most important thing here is fixing things for the people of Flint. We`ve got to make that number one. I do feel that there`s another piece on emergency manager, Rachel, I just want to get in. And that is in 2012, we had a ballot proposal passed statewide to repeal the emergency manager. The state legislature and the governor went back and changed the little bit and put it back in. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, it can`t be repealed by vote again? STABENOW: Right. I want to say this is worse than it sounds. WILLIAMS: In fact, I`d just say, took over every blame city in Michigan. Took over every black city in Michigan. (APPLAUSE) Flint, Detroit, Ecorse, Detroit public schools, Benton Harbor, and has failed at every cities he has taken over. I`m putting in emergency management to keep Detroit from going bankrupt. What happened? Detroit goes bankrupt. I mean, it`s ludicrous and anybody who fails at the rate that Governor Snyder has failed, I would have been fired a long time ago. All I got to say is Governor Snyder got to go. STABENOW: Let me – let me also say one thing I promised I would say to a very special – from a very special person that I talked with today and that is President Obama who wanted me to say thank you to you, wanted me to say thank you to everyone. He loves you and he has your back and we`re going to do everything humanely possibly federally to help. (APPLAUSE) However, it does not take the place of the state. Early on, I made sure that we had ready to feed formula for WIC moms. The state was not stepping up and acting. We now have stepped up on the ground and we`re focused on nutrition. We`re going to get a grocery store in Flint. We`re going to make sure that fresh fruits and vegetables are available to children. Health care, very quickly, Congressman Kildee and Senator Peters and I are going to have an announcement on how we can step up to help with the pipes as well Dr. Mona`s vision on long term. But, Rachel, none of this is takes the place of the fact that the state has a surplus and a rainy day fund. They caused it. They have to step up and fix this. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I want to make sure we get some questions and comments from folks here in the audience. What`s your name? AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Errol Wetson (ph). I`m on the Flint school board. My question is we appreciate all the donations of water coming in our district and city. That`s a temporary fix. What are we going do for a permanent solution? Are going to bring in the Army Corps of Engineers in here to come up with their alternative way of distributing water to the city? As we wait for the infrastructure to be repaired? ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s a good? Senator, do you want to comment on that? STABENOW: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I mean, obviously, that`s one of the things that`s been floated here and it sounds radical but it also sounds real. STABENOW: Well, I think – I mean, I`m happy to do that. I was here all day on Monday, meeting with the mayor. You were in D.C. still. I was meeting with the folks at city hall. And bottled water`s not enough. First of all, the people here deserve the dignity and respect of having water coming out of their facet. But I said, maybe we need to bring in Department of Defense, maybe we need to have big water tankers and so on, Dr. Mona said and one of my heroes, Dr. Mona and Dr. Lurie is here for the president, said that we need to have water filters that fit that are on the facets, every two weeks they need to have a cartridge replaced, people need to know how to do that. If we had that for business and homes – I talked to a gentleman on Monday who has a barber shop, we have to get that fixed. And so, the water filters are a very important piece of this. I say this not because – I don`t trust anything the state says right now, but when the experts that I trust, Dr. Mona and others, are saying water filters work if we get them on right, I think we need to take that seriously. WILLIAMS: With all due respect, I think water filters are important, but at the end of the day, we have been fighting this for two years. STABENOW: Right. (APPLAUSE) WILLIAMS: Folks have been around here. STABENOW: Right. WILLIAMS: When I came here two years ago, almost a year and a half ago, people were coming up to me with rashes, hair falling out, water didn`t smell good. One lady told me that the cat didn`t want to drink the water. I mean, when is enough enough? STABENOW: Right. WILLIAMS: I think if the Governor Snyder wanted to stay in office, which I believe he shouldn`t stay in office, like I said before, if he wanted to stay in office, you need to move to Flint, Michigan, and he need to take a shower right here in Flint, Michigan. Move his family here in Flint, Michigan. (APPLAUSE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' President Charles Williams, president of the National Action Network of Michigan, Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Flint mayor, Karen Weaver – thank you all for being here. I want to tell you that being here in Flint there is a conclusion that I have come to today being here talking to people that I did not expect to come to, the conclusion that I came to is that this crisis is fixable, that it will be fixed. I believe it. What convinced me of that is next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' America does big things. America has done interstate highway system, man on the moon, right? The expectation of clean drinking water everywhere in this country, big things. You here in Flint did nothing to bring this disaster upon yourselves. The poisoning of this town was done to this town by your state government, not by you. And it really is a big disaster and it has consequences for this generation and for generations to come. This is not some little thing that went wrong in a small to medium size city that used to be a little bit bigger. This is – this is a disaster. This is a manmade American disaster of national consequence. And part of the reason we came here tonight is not because I`m from here, I`ve got some Michigan connection here. I don`t. And most Americans aren`t from here and don`t have some specific connection to this place. But we as your fellow Americans have to start thinking about the restoration of this town, the restoration of Flint as one of the big things we need to do as a country. (APPLAUSE) Flint already is strong. You all know how strong you are. You are not alone. It took a while, but America is with you now, Flint, Michigan. (APPLAUSE) It is a matter of getting it done of getting people in place who will do the big things that need to be done to fix this. I am convinced it is going to happen. It is going to be hard, but it has to happen because we as a country will not let something like this lie. I want to say a big thank you to all of our guests tonight. I want to say a huge thank you to everybody who was here tonight. And to our house at the Holmes STEM Academy here in Flint, you guys here, you Flint residents, you`re the ones who are fighting for your own kids, for your own family, your own community, your own state, and ultimately, as Americans, you are fighting for all of us. So, thank you. (APPLAUSE) It`s clear we have a big job ahead and we`re going to stay on this story. Thank you for being with us. Good night.  ']\n",
      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 26, 2016 Guest: Karen Weaver CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: That is “ALL IN” for this evening. THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now. Good evening, Rachel. ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Thank you, my friend. HAYES: You bet. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. I love days like this. Today, as the day got longer, as the sun went down, as afternoon turned to evening, the political news just went completely nuts. If you are a civics dork, you live for days like this. Now if you`re not sure whether or not you are a civics dork, one way to tell is if a news day like today has you grinning from ear to ear at the sheer exciting, unprecedented chaos of it all. Another way to tell if you`re a civics dork is by closely monitoring the feeling that you have when you receive something like this in your mailbox. Now, most people when they get summon to jury duty, they get bummed out, they start complaining, they start thinking about ways to get out of it, but a true civics dork sees something like this in their mailbox, and this is basically up there with like an unexpected tax refund or an unsolicited box of chocolates from your ex who you secretly still have a thing for. This is very exciting. If you are a true civics dork, getting invited to jury duty is cause for much excitement, even celebration. See, for example, the reaction to getting called for jury duty that we got from Missouri`s Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill. Shortly after 9:00 yesterday morning, Senator McCaskill started tweeting her experiences and her excitement about being called up for jury duty in Missouri. Started this one, “Yes, just reported for jury duty. On my bucket list to serve.” She said she`s hoping that she gets picked. She`s creating a suspense about how the process will go. See at the start there, “drum roll”. She tweeted pictures of the jury assembly room and her group number she got on her little badge. You see on the lower right. She explained how she had made a good decision in terms of where to sit in the waiting room with access to a power outlet so she could keep twitting. She counted the number of knitters in the room versus the number of people reading and whether they were reading on a screen, or reading from a book, waiting – people waiting whether they`d be called. She excitedly reported on a little drama in the waiting area. There was apparently some sort of dispute or at least uncertainty over what TV channel the TV in the waiting room would be set on that led her to start the hashtag, quote, “Please God, not FOX News.” They ultimately decided on Comedy Central apparently. She said it was both a good decision and a bad decision. But then there was pure excitement from Senator McCaskill. “OMG, oh my God, I got called. On my way to the courtroom. Yes!” A little later on, she said somebody recognized her at the courthouse and basically told her she wasn`t going to get picked for the jury. She says that person told her, quote, “They don`t want lawyers.” Senator McCaskill is a lawyer. She responded with that little despondent emoji. Such sad news. She wants to be picked so bad. There was more suspense. They got dismissed for lunch apparently. And this is Senator McCaskill saying, you see the time stamp just after 1:00 p.m. “Going to seat us in the courtroom, then dismiss us for lunch. Tease.” Still doesn`t know if she will get picked. But this is true civics dorkdom, right? She`s so excited, she so wants to be on the jury. And this is kind of compelling drama at this point. This point in her Twitter feed, I wrote on Twitter in response to her in the middle of this, “Is it weird that I`m desperate to know if Claire is going to get picked for that jury?” And Senator McCaskill responded right away, “Yes, it`s a little weird.” But no worries, she says, “I will let you know.” I responded. “OK. We`re all pulling for you, Senator.” But then hours went by after the lunch dismissal, remember, it was after 1:00 p.m., they got dismissed for lunch. Between 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., we heard nothing from Senator Claire McCaskill, even though she`d been tweeting excitedly all day. And then boom! Six-thirty last night, all caps. “Holy expletive. I am on the jury.” She got picked. She`s so psyched. This is heaven for any civics dork, right? But particularly for somebody like Claire McCaskill who is not just a civics dork. She`s also a lawyer. She`s a former prosecutor. She`s a Twitter enthusiast, so we get to see all these things about her. But Senator McCaskill is also a really good politician. One of the more interesting conspiracy theories about why she got picked for that jury this week in Missouri is that she`s been a really good surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail and so maybe these were Republican lawyers who don`t want Claire McCaskill stomping for Hillary Clinton in Iowa over the next six days before the Iowa caucuses. This is a surefire way to keep her locked down in a Missouri courtroom, at least for the duration of this now unexpectedly high profile slip and fall case involving the St. Louis convenience store. I don`t think that`s what happened. But Claire McCaskill is a formidable politician. When Claire McCaskill was first elected to the Senate in 2006, she was running as a Democrat in the red state of Missouri. And despite those headwinds, she was able to unseat an incumbent Republican senator that year. So, then, she served her first term in the Senate, basically a centrist red state but outspoken, aggressive Democrat. Then she decided she`d run for re-election when her first term was up in 2012. And the 2012 election was amazing. 2012 election for her Senate seat in Missouri, that was the election that brought us this epic photo series of a sitting U.S. female senator shot gunning a beer in her pajamas. This is from the 2012 re-election race by Claire McCaskill in Missouri. In these photos, she`s settling a bet with her kids. She`s not celebrating a win in that race. That had not happened yet at the point these pictures were taken. What she is celebrating is the results of the Republican primary in that race. She is celebrating in these pictures, who the Republican voters of Missouri chose to be their candidate to run against her for her Senate seat. And the reason she`s celebrating the results of the Republican primary that year is because her campaign spent a ton of money to basically choose her opponent. To choose who she wanted to run against in the general election for that race. In the closing two weeks of that Republican primary in the Missouri Senate race in 2012, Democratic incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill spent more money on the Republican primary than the victorious Republican candidate spent on himself. And she did it with what was ostensibly an attack ad against him. This is how Claire McCaskill chose her own opponent. This is how she chose the winner of the Republican Party in that Senate race this year. This was her ostensible attack ad that she ran specifically as a way to try to sway Republican primary voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI: I`m Claire McCaskill and I approve this message. AD NARRATOR: The most conservative congressman in Missouri as our senator, Todd Akin. A crusader against bigger government, Akin would completely eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy, and privatize Social Security. Todd`s pro-family agenda would outlaw many forms of contraception and Akin alone says President Obama is a complete menace to our civilization. Todd Akin, Missouri`s true conservative is just too conservative. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Missouri`s true conservative. So, technically, that was a negative ad against Todd Akin run by Senator Claire McCaskill. But, clearly, it was a negative ad that was basically begging hard core Republican primary voters to vote for the true conservative Todd Akin. And Missouri Republican voters did just that. He became the Republican nominee and Senator McCaskill shotgunned a beer in her PJs to celebrate and her chosen opponent Todd Akin went onto inevitably to talk about legitimate rape, right, in the election campaign and say a lot of other things beside, and Claire McCaskill squashed him like a bug. She beat him by 15 points in red state Missouri, even as her state went for Mitt Romney on that same night by almost 10 points. They put Democrat Claire McCaskill back in the Senate by a mile. The $2 million she spent to choose Todd Akin as her opponent, that was $2 million well-spent. Well, now, today, it`s happening again. Part of the way you can tell is again Claire McCaskill`s Twitter feed. Her first post-jury duty Twitter feed – tweet on her Twitter feed, was this last night. It says, quote, “I see you Joe Ricketts. And I know exactly what you`re up to. #ToddAkin. Don`t fall for it, Iowa Democrats.” And what she links to is a “New York Times” story about a new super PAC ad being run in Iowa by a Republican donor named Joe Ricketts. Now, the Ricketts family, they have been huge supporters in this presidential race of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. The problem for the Ricketts family is that Scott Walker pooped out really early in the Republican primary. So, the Ricketts family has a ton of money. They love to spend their money to try to help Republicans win elections. They`ve got a keen interest in this presidential election, but apparently, they don`t like any of the other Republican presidential candidates as much as they like their old guy Scott Walker. So, what they`ve apparently to spend their money on is not choosing any one Republican candidate over any of the others. Not picking a favorite in the Republican primary, but instead, they are trying to spend their money choosing a Democratic opponent for whoever the Republican nominee is likely to be. So, Joe`s super PAC has pulled a page from the Claire McCaskill playbook, and they have started running this ostensibly negative ad in Iowa to try to affect the Iowa Democratic primary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AD NARRATOR: Senator Bernie Sanders has some very big plans. Bernie wants to provide free college for our young people, no tuition, completely free. Now, Bernie`s doubling down with Medicare for all, which is basically single-payer government-sponsored health care. No big insurance companies, just more government spending, paid for by raising taxes on Wall Street, big business and the super rich. Senator Bernie Sanders, too liberal for Iowa. ESA Fund is responsible for the content of this ad. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Bernie Sanders is so liberal. Free college for our young people. No more big insurance companies. Raising taxes on Wall Street, big business and the super rich. I see what you`re doing there. This ad is now running in Iowa. It`s a big buy. They are apparently spending $600,000 to run this ad, a gazillion times in Iowa over next six days before the Iowa caucuses. In addition to this $600,000 TV ad buy, there`s also reportedly a substantial radio buy for this ad and a substantial online buy for this ad as well. This is ham-handed, right? It`s easy to see what they are doing. They are trying to get liberal Iowa caucus-goers to like Bernie Sanders more and vote for him. But this is a Republican effort to influence the Democratic primary in Iowa, right? They are trying to persuade liberal Democratic Iowa caucus- goers, they ought to choose Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton, because he`s so liberal. Apparently, these Republican donors would rather have Bernie Sanders win Iowa than Hillary Clinton. They would rather have Bernie Sanders as an opponent for whoever the Republican nominee will be in a general election. So, it`s a fake negative ad. It`s Republican interference in the Democratic primary. It`s not quite a dirty trick. It`s like a stealth knuckle ball in politics. I told you this is time of year when things are about to get weird. Things are getting weird. Now, in terms of the Democratic campaigns themselves, both Hillary Clinton`s campaign and Bernie Sanders have released today ads that are believed to be their final ads before the Iowa caucuses. Now, they could always release something later but for right now, this is what we`re expecting to be their closing arguments before Iowa. And whatever you think about Republicans waiting into the Democratic race and the fake negative ad being run by the super PAC in Iowa, if you actually go to these candidate themselves, what they are each making as closing arguments is not about their opponent. It`s about themselves, it`s positive, very positive. And Hillary Clinton`s campaign, it`s a positive biographical ad. And in Bernie Sanders` case, it`s a positive and basically inspirational sum up of his platform. Again, we think these are the two closing argument ads for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. We think this is the last each of them is going to run before the Iowa caucuses on Monday. Now, in terms of their closing argument to New Hampshire voters, because right after Iowa, New Hampshire is two weeks from today. What`s going to be the last word that New Hampshire voters get from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton before New Hampshire goes to vote? We know what their last words are in Iowa. What are the last words will be in New Hampshire? I`m glad you asked, because that is another part of politics that went absolutely nuts today. It involves “The Union Leader” newspaper in New Hampshire. It involves me and Chuck Todd and the possibility that the Democratic candidates may decide to break down Democratic Party rules and do an illegal, unsanctioned debate that`s off the Democratic Party schedule. That is totally not allowed in Democratic Party politics, but maybe they`re going to do it anyway? That`s part of what made today so absolutely nuts in terms of political news. Today on both the Republican side and Democratic side, candidates took steps that could basically blow up the primary process as it has been controlled by both parties. And a lot of this is still unsettled, still breaking tonight. It turns out we are right in the middle of it. But it`s all ahead this hour. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Did you hear late today that chuck Todd and I are going to be moderating a newly scheduled presidential debate? I heard that today too. Very exciting. Also, I`m not sure what it all means. I`m not sure, at this point, if it`s actually happening, which is strange because it`s supposed to happen next week. Strange, exciting. Actual intrigue. We`ve got that story ahead tonight. We`ve also got the mayor of Flint, Michigan, joining us live tonight. We`ve got lots to come. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, we`re going to hear in just a moment about the latest drama on the Republican side in the 2016 presidential race, which is the late- breaking news that Donald Trump, the Republican`s frontrunner is apparently planning on sitting out the next Republican presidential debate – the one that`s scheduled for Thursday night, the last one before Iowa. He said he`s sitting it out because he does not like one of the moderators that the FOX News Channel is planning on using at that debate. We`re going to have details on that including a live report from NBC reporter who has been embedded with the Trump campaign. That`s coming up in just a moment. But there`s also some significant drama on the Democratic side tonight, where there have been far fewer debates than the Republicans have had. The Democrats have only scheduled six debates in total for their entire primary season this year. Four of them have already happened. They`ve only got two more scheduled. One on February 11th and one on March 9th. That sparse schedule has a source of consternation and criticism throughout the Democratic campaign, including sometimes on this hour on this show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is this lack of debates on the Democratic side and hiding them in these obscure places in the schedule, is it a big enough problem that you and the other candidates might revolt and try to at least get another one scheduled? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, look, when the Republicans do primetime debates, they get 20 million, 25 million people watching it. When we have debates, the one here in Iowa was literally on the night of a huge football game. I think it was Iowa State versus the University of Iowa, probably the worst time you could schedule a debate. If we want to win in November, it is important that the American people hear our ideas. And debates are one way that millions of people can hear our ideas and hear the differences between the candidates. So, I think we have got to do a lot better than that. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m struck by the fact that even though the Republicans just had a debate and they`re about to have another debate before Iowa, there isn`t another Democratic debate before Iowa or before the primary in New Hampshire. Do you wish there were more debates? Are you enjoying these debates when they do happen? HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I love the debates. I really do. I feel that it gives me chance to get up on the stage and explain my positions, answer questions from the moderators, draw contrast with my opponents. So, it`s been a good experience for me so far. I think it`s helped me make my case for my candidacy. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, if you and Senator Sanders and Governor O`Malley ever decide that you want more and you don`t want to negotiate it, you can all just show up here and I`ll help. CLINTON: We did have that great forum that you moderated. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In South Carolina. That`s right. CLINTON: Yes, that got a lot of good response. So, we sure have enough attention to this campaign. So, I hope whatever the format is for getting us before the voters, it will encourage more people to come out and caucus and vote in the primary. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Given that you feel like Southern states aren`t getting their due from the Democratic Party, given that you feel like the Democratic Party screwed up in the way they scheduled the debates, given that you said from the beginning that there ought to be more of these debates, I feel like the candidates are sort of more important than the party is. Do you and Governor O`Malley and Secretary Clinton, do you envisage the three of you getting together and telling the party to stuff it and doing it the way all three of you articulate you`d rather do it? SANDERS: Well, count me in as one person, you know, if Secretary Clinton and Governor O`Malley want to do it, I`m there. I love debates. I think they are way to inform the American people about positions and our differences. So, I think that is a great idea. So, I`m in. If the other candidates are in, you count me in. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m never the one who starts these things but I feel like I may be starting something here. (END VIDEO CLIPS) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Apparently, we were starting something there. All right. Here`s what happened today, “The Union Leader” newspaper in New Hampshire, biggest newspaper in New Hampshire, has been seriously advocating that there ought to be a Democratic debate before the New Hampshire primary this year. Every year, there`s been a contested Democratic primary going back to 1984. There`s apparently been a debate right before the New Hampshire primary. This is the first year that hasn`t happened since 1984. Today, “The Union Leader” announced that they are planning on hosting an unsanctioned Democratic Party debate right before the New Hampshire primary next Thursday night, February 4th. “The Union Leader” has asked MSNBC to be their media partner. MSNBC has said that Chuck Todd and I will participate in the debate. We will moderate. Now, it`s a question of figuring out if the candidates will come. So, the Democratic Party doesn`t want to do this. The Democratic Party says six is enough. They say they will not sanction anymore debates until after the New Hampshire primary. They had said that before the primary process started, that any candidate who participated in a non-sanctioned debate would forfeit the ability to participate in any of the further sanctioned events. But again, there`s not that many further sanctioned events. There`s only two more debates scheduled altogether. What are they going to do, hold the debates without any candidates there because the candidates all decided to debate in New Hampshire? Well, this is what the campaigns have said since “The Union Leader” made their announcement. Martin O`Malley says he`s in. Quote, “We look forward to participating.” Hillary Clinton`s campaign says this, quote, “Hillary Clinton would be happy to participate in a debate in New Hampshire, if the other candidates agree, which would allow the DNC to sanction the debate.” We reach out to the Bernie Sanders campaign tonight. His communications director told us this, quote, “We will be working with the DNC and other campaigns to schedule additional debates.” So, wait a minute. Does that mean we`re having a debate next Thursday or not? “The New York Times” is reporting tonight that Sanders campaign is saying that he will not participate in the unsanctioned MSNBC/”New Hampshire Union Leader” debate because it could risk him being denied participation in future debates. The DNC tonight, again, says they will not sanction that debate. They will not sanction anymore debates until New Hampshire is over. They`ve said explicitly they won`t sanction until after New Hampshire. But who holds the cards here, the candidates or the party? At this point, the DNC says they won`t sanction. The candidates all say that will be happy to do it if the Democratic Party sanctions it. Why won`t the Democratic Party sanction it? And what happens if they don`t and all the Democrats do it any way? Are they not allow all the Democratic candidates to participate in any further debates? Who does that serve? So, Maybe Chuck Todd and I are moderating a debate with “The Union Leader” next week in New Hampshire. Maybe we`re not. But, honestly, if you`re a politics junkie and you can stand a little ambiguity, a little uncertainty in your timeline, this year is the best of all years. This is the best of all times. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDOE CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anything else that you want to add about Trump? Do you see an endorsement coming very soon from you? DR. DAVID DUKE: Well, I have not endorsed him. As far as what I see, according to the candidates that are out there now, Republicans and Democrats, I think he`s head and shoulders right now above the rest. I don`t agree with everything he says. He speaks a little more – actually, he speaks a lot more radically than I talk. I think that`s a positive and negative. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke excited about Donald Trump`s presidential campaign, although the former Klan leader says sometimes Mr. Trump is a little over the top in the way he speaks compared to David Duke.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIPS) JARED TAYLOR: I`m Jared Taylor with American Renaissance. I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America. We don`t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump. WILLIAM JOHNSON: I am William Johnson, a farmer and a white nationalist. Support Donald Trump. (END AUDIO CLIPS) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That robocall went out on behalf of Donald Trump in Iowa a couple of weeks ago. The ad was not authorized by Mr. Trump or paid for by him. But whether or not Mr. Trump likes it, the white supremacists of our country have really chosen him as their guy this year. And today, we got the latest twist on that windy little road. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE SEN. JAKE KNOTTS, JR. (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: In the next three days, find out that her daddy wears a turban around Lexington and her mama wears a ruby between her head and she is a sheik and trying to be a Methodist and gets to Greenville around the Bob Jones University people, they`re not going to like that. With Pat Robinson sending out that e-mail, people need to look at that. We got a – we got a rag head in Washington. We don`t need a rag head in the state house. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' South Carolina Republican State Senator Jake Knotts speaking in 2010, talking about then-Republican candidate for South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley. State Senator Knotts did not remain a state senator for long after that tape saw the light of day. But now, he`s back in the public eye, because now, he is announcing his pick for the Republican nomination. Guess who he likes? Not only is the “we don`t need a rag head in the state house” guy endorsing Donald Trump for president, he`s also scheduled to appear on stage with Mr. Trump at a campaign rally in South Carolina tomorrow afternoon. Mr. Trump today also got a much hyped endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. Sheriff Joe was found guilty of racial profiling against Latinos in 2013. Mr. Trump today said Sheriff Arpaio`s endorsement, quote, “means a lot to me.” And despite the beltway certainty that Ted Cruz has locked up all the high profile evangelical endorsements in the country, today, Donald Trump was also endorsed by Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University. Jerry Falwell Jr. said that Mr. Trump reminds him of his dad, the late televangelist. Things are weird in the world of Donald Trump for president these days. But whatever you think of how he is doing it, he is doing it. He`s winning that race. He`s up by 16 points nationwide in the new “Washington Post” poll. He`s up by 22 points in a new CNN national poll. Iowa was once a Ted Cruz stronghold, but Donald Trump is winning in Iowa in four out of last five polls there, including the new one out today from Quinnipiac, which is close, but Donald Trump is leading Ted Cruz by two. In the latest New Hampshire polling for “The Boston Herald”, it`s not close at all. He`s ahead by a whopping 19-point margin in New Hampshire. And when you`re that far ahead, maybe that means you have the luxury to blow up the process. This was Mr. Trump tonight saying he`s not or at least he`s probably not going to attend the next Republican debate. This will be the last Republican debate before Iowa. It`s supposed to happen this upcoming Thursday, a day after tomorrow. He says he might not do it because he doesn`t like one of the moderators who the FOX News Channel has chosen for that debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, FOX is playing games. Yes. FOX is going to make a fortune. I told FOX you should give money to the Wounded Warriors. I`m not a fan of Megyn Kelly. I think she`s a third rate reporter. I think she frankly is not good at what she does, and I think they could do a lot better than Megyn Kelly. And so, I`m going to be making a decision with FOX, but I probably won`t bother doing the debate. I see they picked me as number one. Not only number one, number one by far. But probably, I won`t be doing the debate. I`m going to have something else in Iowa. We`ll do something where we raise money for the veterans and the Wounded Warriors. We`re going to do something simultaneously with the debate, but most likely, I`m not going to do the debate. I didn`t like the fact they sent out press releases toying, talking about Putin and playing games. I don`t know what games Roger Ailes is playing, but what`s wrong over there? Something`s wrong. When they sent out that press release talking about, I said what are these people playing games? So, most likely, I won`t be doing the debate. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump saying tonight he most likely will not participate in the next Republican debate, the last debate before Iowa. His campaign manager clarified after that statement from the candidate himself. The campaign manager said, quote, “He`s definitely not participating in the debate.” Now, this comes after Mr. Trump has been complaining for days about the inclusion of FOX News hosts Megyn Kelly as one of the debate`s moderators. He even posted a poll online asking his supporters if he should participate in the debate. That led the FOX News Channel to put out one of their patented PR department statements, quote, “We learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and Putin intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president. A nefarious source sells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings” – which is hilarious in public relations sophomore year class. But it appears to have backfired in the real world, in national politics. And now, Mr. Trump is not going to be in the FOX News debate. And at this late date in the last week before Iowa, with Iowa looking like it`s really close, what effect is going to have on the race for him to sit out the debate? I mean, who knows what effect that`s going to have on the race? Who knows what effect that`s going to have on whether or not people watch that debate without Donald Trump in it, particularly if he does a competing event somewhere else at the same time? That said, we did also learn today that Rand Paul has been asked back to participate in the debate this time from the main stage and we learned today from FOX News that Jim Gilmore has been invited back to be at the kids table again. So, maybe Donald Trump doesn`t matter at all. Maybe America will tune in for that. Joining us now from Marshall Town, Iowa, is NBC News political reporter Katy Tur. Katy, thanks very much for being with us. KATY TUR, NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, Mr. Trump has made his threats before. In October, he threatened to pull out of the CNBC debate unless his demands were met. He did the same thing in December for a CNN debate. Now, his campaign is saying nothing will change his mind. He`s definitely not showing up on Thursday. Do you believe him? TUR: It seems like the campaign is much more serious about this than they`ve been in the past with their past threats. In fact, just released a statement and it says in part, “As the person who wrote `The Art of the Deal`, Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one.” It goes onto say why he`s not going to be participating in this FOX News debate and he says he`s going to have, as you mentioned, an alternate event where he is going to raise money for Wounded Warriors and veterans also here in Iowa. I think right now, we`re hearing they`re trying to find another network to compete – to counter programming with the debate to air that special with Donald Trump. Who knows if they`re going to be able to do that? We`ve also been reaching out to Wounded Warriors and other veteran groups, to find out if the campaign has reached out to them yet. So far, no response. It sounds like this is in the beginning planning stages. They`d just decided this spur of the moment, this afternoon. And when I`ve spoken to the RNC, they didn`t know about this until Donald Trump announced it at this press conference. They say that basically it`s up to the campaign to decide whether or not they want to participate in this debate. But I think everyone is going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to find out if this is really something that is happening. He has threatened the boycott FOX News in the past a number of times, but has ultimately started appearing on their show. This is different, though, Rachel. They are releasing statement. They are getting pretty serious about this one. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Katy, as far as I understand the party rules. We have been looking at party rules because the Democrats are considering whether or not to do an unsanctioned debate. There`s no consequences, no spelled out consequences in case a candidate decides not to show up to a debate to which he or she is invited. That said, the mentioned from the campaign of “The Art of the Deal” and their statement about this, I wonder if it`s possible that Mr. Trump is trying to get some sort of concession out of FOX, trying to give FOX to give him something he can`t get from them in exchange for him participating on Thursday. TUR: I think he`s playing a game of chicken with FOX. I think FOX is not necessarily the network to do that. They are not necessarily going to back down. They have backing Megyn Kelly throughout this entire campaign. This war he`s waged on Megyn Kelly over Twitter for the past seven months and in a number of campaign speeches. So, I don`t think FOX is necessarily going to back down after this. The RNC says they will not get involved. This is not a situation like we saw with “The National Review” where they were against Donald Trump. It`s also not a situation like “The Union Leader” in New Hampshire which is also kicked out of a debate because they endorsed Chris Christie. This is a different situation. This is about questions and about moderators. And this is not the RNC`s purview. They have said it`s up to each campaign to decide whether or not they want to participate. Obviously, they said they would like all the campaigns and the candidates to be on that stage. But if they decide they don`t want to, they`re not going to do anything about it. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Katy Tur, NBC News political reporter with us, with the Trump campaign right now in Iowa – Katy, thank you very much. Really appreciate it. TUR: Thank you, Rachel.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' As you know, we`re going to have a show tomorrow night from Flint, Michigan. We`re doing what`s basically a town hall on the mass lead poisoning of that city and what`s going to happen next in that city because of it. We`re going to do that tomorrow. Tonight, we`re about to speak with the mayor of Flint, Michigan. We wanted to talk to her tonight ahead of that town hall, talk to her about the situation and the city. We found tonight that we could only get her on the phone. We couldn`t get her in front of camera because she`s been in a long meeting all day or at least all night tonight with Michigan`s governor, Rick Snyder. And it turns out, out of that meeting, there`s some big news as to what is about to happen in Michigan, what Michigan is asking for. This is a totally different scale from anything we have heard before. And that and the mayor are next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' OK. We have some breaking news to report out of Flint, Michigan. In terms of the response to the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, President Obama, you`ll remember last week dispatched this person, Dr. Nicolle Lurie, to be on site in Flint, heading up the federal response to the mass poisoning there. Dr. Lurie hit the ground in Flint last week, again, as the federal point person for this crisis. Late this evening, we`re getting new news of what kind of federal help she might be asked to muster and coordinate. Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan tonight says she is requesting that the federal government provide medical care for young people in Flint. He`s going to ask Dr. Lurie`s agency, the public health service, to cover long term health care for people in Flint under the age of 21. Governor Snyder says tonight that he wants a Flint specific expansion of Medicaid. So, that federal health insurance program will cover every young person in Flint regardless of income. He`s asking for comprehensive medical treatment for the long haul for all Flint kids because they all drank that lead poisoned water because of what his administration did. Now, that is apparently request coming from the state of Michigan. We have not heard back from the public health service on this request. But this is new. What Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is asking for from the federal government, long term help, medical help for people who live in Flint and especially long term help for Flint`s kids. Joining us now is the mayor of Flint, Michigan. I`m told that Mayor Karen Weaver is on the phone with us and not in front of a camera because she just got out of a long meeting with Governor Rick Snyder on this very subject. Mayor Weaver, thank you so much for being with us. Thanks for joining us. KAREN WEAVER, MAYOR OF FLINT, MI (via telephone): Thank you. And I apologize I couldn`t be there in person. But we just finished up. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, can you tell us about what happened in this meeting. What you understand to be the current state of the governor`s request for federal help and the next steps for Flint? WEAVER: You know what, let me say this, I had the opportunity to not only have this meeting with him but I was always in the meeting when our national state and local president sat down from the NAACP sat down and put some requests in place as well. But one of the things when you were talking about, the medical help that is going to be coming for Medicaid to be expanding. You know, those are things we have wanted. We know we have to get the kids identified to know what they need. These are really good first steps. We still have to put the services in place they will need from here on out. That`s what we have to look at as well. We still have to have a com comprehensive set of services for kids and families. But I was really pleased with this first step. I will be meeting with Dr. Lurie. I just got back in town early this morning. I was in the snowstorm. I have not had the opportunity to sit down with her a second time. But that`s what we want to look at is how do we extend all these kinds of services for kids. You know, we want to look at other services. We want to look at extending WIC. We want to look at extending Head Start, those kinds of things as well. So, that`s what we`re drying to put in place. The other thing that the governor talked about is, you know, I`ve been saying that the $28 million isn`t enough. The governor said he recognizes that as well. That was another up with of his first steps. Now, the budget is going to be put in place probably within the month and so, what I`m working on now with my team is getting some figures to him, because we`re doing another ask. We need some more money. I just want it to be very clear with him this is what we need to have happened next. He has given some first steps that we are in favor of, we appreciate, but we know we need more, because some of the other things we have to look here in the city of Flint is what`s happening to our economy as a result of this water. You know, our economy has gone down. Our businesses have gone down. People aren`t coming into certain, to restaurants. People can`t afford filtration systems for restaurants. Businesses will leave here. So, we are also putting an economic development plan in place for the city of Flint, in addition, to the services a and support the kids and families will need. So, we have to look at other things because Flint has been impacted in so many ways as a result of what`s happened. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Mayor Weaver, in terms of recovery of Flint, I`m very moved by what you`re saying in terms of supporting kids and supporting their families in terms of kids that have been exposed. I`m also thinking about the risk of continued exposure. We see all that bottled water being brought in to Flint and that is great and in many cases, it`s heart warming to see those donations, but you can`t indefinitely run a city of 100,000 people where everything has to be done with water in plastic bottles. So, what about the – what about the pipes? What about the lead pipes that were ruined in the city? WEAVER: Exactly, because we`ve – I`m sorry. We`ve got to get started on those lead service lines. That was one of the other things. So, maybe I neglected to say that. We`ve got to get working on that. We know it`s a difficult time because it`s winter right now and there are parts of the ground that are frozen, but that`s one of our priorities. We`ve got to get that going, because you`re absolutely right. We don`t any when this film will build back up. We cannot survive on bottled water for an extended period of time. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Karen Weaver, mayor of Flint, Michigan – Mayor, thank you for your time tonight, especially when you are so busy and doing what you`re doing for your city and I know we`re going to see you tomorrow night at our town hall in Flint. I really appreciate it. WEAVER: We are looking forward to it. We appreciate you as well. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Not nearly as much as I`m looking forward to it, ma`am. Thank you. I`ll see you then. Thank you. WEAVER: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. We`ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' (AUDIO GAP) Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage? Her fixation on him is kind of bizarre. Quote, “Does Rachel have ties to Maine. If not, what is her weird fascination with him?” Quote, “What`s with Maddow`s obsession with the governor?” That verbatim is what the office of the Governor Paul LePage of Maine has been willing to tell us over the past week or so when we have repeatedly inquired as to whether or not Governor LePage was going to give his state of the state speech in amine this year. The reason we were asking is because Governor LePage had threatened not to give that speech this year because the legislator had recently debated whether or not they were going to impeach him. He was so offended by that debate over his potential impeachment that he said he might mail the speech into the legislator instead of actually showing up in person and delivering it. The governor`s office basically called me a nut job for even asking if he had made up his mind about that issue. And we were – that`s how far we were in the story as of this time last night. But now, today, Governor LePage has apparently made up his mind. This closely guarded secret about whether or not he`s going to give the state of the state in person, it`s now been let out. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GOV. PAUL LEPAGE (R), MAINE: The truth is I`m going do to do a state of the state in writing so people can`t change my words. HOST: OK. So, you will not do a live state of the state and you will send a letter to the legislature? LEPAGE: Right. It makes so sense. Last week they tried to impeach me. This week, they`re throwing rotten tomatoes in front of me. Why would I go stand in front of them for an hour and a half? (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So just to be clear, the governor is going do the state of the state address in main this year in writing, quote, “so people can`t change my words,” because he thinks people change his words when he speaks them, but not when he writes them. I haven`t really been obsessed unnaturally with the governor of Maine, but I`m starting to be. I`m starting to be. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So as you have heard tomorrow night we`re going to be broadcasting the show from Flint, Michigan. We`re going to be hosting a town hall there on the water crisis, on this American disaster in Flint created when the state government lead poisoned that whole town. We`re going to be holding the town hall at an elementary school in Flint called the Holmes STEM Academy. We`re going to do it in the school gym. We`re being advised that apparently the event is going to be packed. We`re also starting to hear about people throwing watch parties for the event like this one at Luigi`s Restaurant and Pizzeria in Flint which is going to be hosted by the Michigan State Senator Jim Ananich. It`s going to include free pizza and salad and soft drinks and naturally bottled water. We have heard about another one being held tomorrow night in Ann Arbor, another watch party there. If there are other watch parties you guys are planning on doing for the Flint town hall, let us know by email. You just e-mail them to us at Rachel@msnbc.com. At the town hall, of course, we`re going to be discussing what happened in Flint, why and how it happened, and most importantly, I was just discussing with the mayor, we`re going to be talking about what needs to happen right now to fix this. I think there`s been a misconception in the country that because there`s a lot of attention to Flint, that that means it`s kind of over or it`s done or it`s being attended to. That`s not necessarily the case. But tomorrow night, we`re going to be joined by many of the people central to the story of what has happened in Flint and elected officials like Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, local champions like Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who`s the doctor who first exposed the elevated lead levels in the blood of Flint`s kids. But most importantly, the people who are going to be there tomorrow in bulk are the people of Flint, people who of knew immediately there was something wrong with their water, despite authorities assuring them for over a year that their water was not safe, people who spoke out when nobody would listen, and people who today despite all the national attention, as far as we can tell, at least, they`re still not getting the help they need. We have invited Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to attend tomorrow`s event. As of this evening, he hasn`t said one way or the other. Hope springs eternal. That`s all tomorrow night, 9:00 right here. We hope you can join us and possibly your neighbors at a watch party near you. That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time with “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.   ']\n",
      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 25, 2016 Guest: Jason Noble, Bryn Mickle CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts now. Good evening, Rachel. ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Thanks, my friend. HAYES: You bet. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. So, this is the time when weird stuff starts to happen. I don`t mean, you know, 9:00 on MSNBC is when weird stuff happens, although sometimes that`s true too. What I mean is a week before Iowa is when weird stuff starts to happen. It`s around this time every four years when we get two things happening at once. First, beltway reporters start writing these wistful, patronizing, reductive little sing song lullabies about how sweet and quaint everything is in Iowa with all these little Iowa people going to their little caucuses and how little and pure it is, right? It restores your faith in the American political process. Right? Every four years. You get that stuff from beltway reporters. Simultaneously every four years, at this time, yet you see those articles from the Beltway and in Iowa, at the exact at the same time stuff starts to get really freaking sketchy. In some cases, it gets downright criminally corrupt. Iowa may be rural and it may be landlocked but Iowans are not rubes. Iowans are pros. And honestly, be on your toes. Be ready for anything. We are now seven days from Iowa. Last time around in 2012, it was six days from Iowa when we got a shocking change on the Republican side. You might remember this. In 2012, Michele Bachmann did very well in the early days in Iowa, right? She won the Ames, Iowa, straw poll. She locked up a lot of endorsements in the state. Then, six days before the Iowa caucuses, in 2012, Michele Bachmann`s statewide campaign co-chair called a press conference to announce that at a that late date with less than a week to go before the caucuses, he was changing his allegiance. He would no longer be Michele Bachmann`s Iowa state co-chair. Instead, he was going to support Rand Paul – excuse me, Ron Paul. And the Michele Bachmann campaign went nuts. And it was this big, shocking ripple through the race. Nobody knew to expect it. Nobody knew what was going on there. Now, we do know what was going on there. Turns out Michele Bachmann`s Iowa co-chair switched his allegiance six days before the caucuses because they paid him to. That Michele Bachmann Iowa state co-chair in 2012, he was an Iowa state senator at the time. He has since pled guilty to federal charges. He admitted to taking money from the Ron Paul campaign to switch his endorsement and then helping cover up that bribe. He is facing up to 25 years in prison in this Iowa Republican caucuses bribery case. The reason he hasn`t been sentenced yet, though, is because it turns out the case is still ongoing. Three Ron Paul aides were indicted last August in the scheme. One of them ultimately had the charges against him dropped. One of them was convicted, and one of them was acquitted. Although the one acquitted is now being charged again. Prosecutors indicted him again this past November. And this is not ancient history. This is what happened the last time around in the Republican caucuses in Iowa. Last presidential cycle, this bribery thing happened. And there are still pending charges and one guy is still awaiting sentencing. There`s ongoing drama and suspense around who was going to go to prison and for how long. And the bribery case from the Iowa Republican caucuses from 2012. That said the question, as to whether or not there was bribery in the Iowa Republican caucuses, that is a settled matter. There`s no drama or suspense about that. The bribery definitely happened. It`s only a question of who is going to get in trouble for it. But that`s apparently how Republicans in Iowa – not only did it in 2012. It`s apparently how they`ve been doing the caucuses for awhile now. At least that`s how it seems based on the indictments. Part of the reason we got the detail in the Ron Paul campaign bribery indictments is because they have a long back and forth negotiation between the Ron Paul campaign and the state senator about how much he wanted to get paid when he was going take this bribe for his support. The state senator, it turns out, he had elaborate expectations how much his endorsement would be worth in the Iowa Republican caucuses because he knew there was a real market for it. The reason he knew there was a market for it, in part, because the Michele Bachmann campaign had been bribing him too. He was trying to trade up. So, yes, at one level, the Iowa caucuses are adorable. How quaint. How sweetly small town America. On the other hand, the Iowa caucuses are kind of gangster. And not just about the process, also, about the results. Por ejemplo, again, just looking at the last time the Republicans held their caucuses in Iowa. Do you remember who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 on the Republican side? If you don`t remember, don`t beat yourself up about it. There are a lot of right answers to that question. Night of the Iowa caucuses in 2012, this was the first thing that the Iowa Republican state chairman announced about the results of the caucuses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT STRAWN, IOWA GOP CHAIRMAN: I can report with 1,770 precincts reporting, Governor Mitt Romney received 30,015 votes, Senator Rick Santorum received 30,007 votes. Congratulations to Governor Mitt Romney, winner of the 2012 Iowa caucuses. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the state Republican Party chairman comes out in Iowa the night of the caucuses and says, hey, Mitt Romney won. That was the night of the caucuses. Then two weeks later, it turns out Mitt Romney did not win the Iowa caucuses. Republican Party two weeks after the caucuses were held told “The Des Moines Register,” for their edition that came out January 19th. Quote, “It is a split decision.” Split decision. It`s a tie. How can it be a tie? It`s an election. I mean, shouldn`t there be a tie breaker if it`s a tie? Nope. And then by later that afternoon, the Republican Party of Iowa had decided to change its mind again. They decided that they would decide who won the tie. In fact, they decided that it wasn`t Mitt Romney and it wasn`t a tie after all. Actually, a different guy won it. Rick Santorum won. Remember, just that same morning the party had said it was a split decision, but then in the afternoon the state party chairman said this: (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) STRAWN: It is indisputable that the certified caucus results had Rick Santorum winning by 34 votes. I feel I owe Senator Santorum`s supporters and his folks an apology. JAN MICKELSON: So, you`re declaring this, then, a victory for Rick Santorum? STRAWN: Yes, the certified vote results. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the last time Republicans held their Iowa caucuses that night they declared Romney won. Two weeks later they said that was tie. A split decision, then that afternoon, they decided it wasn`t a split decision after all. It was a Rick Santorum victory. And then in the end, who got the presidential nominating contests delegates from the state of Iowa for 2012? After they went through that whole make it up as we go along rigmarole? It turns out it was neither of the candidates who won or tied, fending on which day you ask. Neither of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' And now 16 weeks after the voting happened, and Mitt Romney was declared the winner, and 14 weeks after Santorum was declared the winner, now, it appears that Ron Paul is the winner in Iowa. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Mitt Romney first, then a tie, then it was Rick Santorum, then, Ron Paul got all the delegates, or at least almost all the delegates. That, of course, was before three of his aides got indicted on federal criminal charges for the way they bribed their way to the victory. Can we call it a victory? Iowa gets treated by the beltway press like it`s some cross between a Hallmark card and a Norman Rockwell painting and a slice of apple pie with a puppy on top, right? But Iowa, at least on the Republican side of the caucuses, has been kind of a banana republic in recent years. I don`t mean the clothing store. After the debacle in 2012 in the Iowa Republican caucuses, not only did Ron Paul get almost all of the votes, all of the indictments out of the caucuses that year, Ron Paul supporters also briefly took over the Iowa Republican Party. And that lasted for a few years before Iowa`s long serving Republican Governor Terry Branstad decided to end all of that. He waded into Iowa state internal Republican politics and took back over the party through the Ron Paul lights out. This time around for 2016, Terry Branstad is still Iowa`s Republican governor. He`s the longest serving governor in U.S. history in any state. He`s serving his sixth four-year term in Iowa. So, Terry Branstad is a fixture. He`s been through a lot of Iowa caucuses. He`s basically said he`ll stay neutral through the Iowa caucus process, so as not to put his thumb on the scale for that otherwise pristine ethical contest. This year, already, though, Governor Branstad has stretched, if not broken that promise. He has not explicitly endorsed a Republican candidate this year, but he did go out of his way last week to say explicitly that he opposite of endorses Ted Cruz. He`s not telling Iowa Republicans who they should vote for, but he is telling them explicitly, “don`t you dare vote for Ted Cruz”, which is a way to put your thumb on the scale, if you`re a long serving governor of that state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TERRY BRANSTAD (R), IOWA: I believe that would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him. I know he`s ahead in the polls, but the only poll that counts is the one that they take on caucus night. I think it could change between now and then. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Iowa`s long serving Governor Terry Branstad speaking last week. And, you know, it may have had an effect. The polling that came out of Iowa over the last few days does show Ted Cruz basically losing his lead in that state. Three polls have come out of Iowa in the last two days. All three of them show Donald Trump now polling back ahead of Ted Cruz in Iowa. That includes the latest poll out tonight from FOX News in Iowa, which shows Donald Trump leading Ted Cruz in the state by 11 points. New polling in New Hampshire tonight also has Donald Trump doing very well, even better than he has been doing before. The FOX News poll out tonight in New Hampshire has Donald Trump leading Ted Cruz in that state by 17 points. The CBS News poll out in New Hampshire tonight also has him leading big in New Hampshire by 18 points. The CNN poll out over the weekend has Donald Trump leading in New Hampshire by 20 points. So, it has looked before like Ted Cruz was going to win Iowa. Donald Trump is now ahead in the polls again in Iowa. And he`s really ahead in New Hampshire. Sort of feels the like Donald Trump had a scare there for awhile with Ted Cruz. But with numbers like this, there isn`t much reason for him to be scared anymore. Let me give you a wild card, though, which is that guy. Follow the arrow. Yes. That guy. Chris Christie. Chris Christie polling at roughly 6 or 7 percent these days in New Hampshire, which on a good day has him tied for fifth place. Most days further behind than that. Governor Christie is betting all his presidential prospects to New Hampshire. He`s basically moved to New Hampshire full time. Actually, I don`t need to qualify that. He hasn`t basically moved to New Hampshire full time. He has moved to New Hampshire full time. That`s why it was news this weekend when he left New Hampshire for less than 48 hours to go home to New Jersey where he`s still the governor so he could oversee response to winter storm Jonas. Jonas hit New Jersey with a ton of snow and also with some pretty serious coastal flooding along the Jersey shore. Governor Christie initially said he wouldn`t need to leave New Hampshire to oversee the response to that storm. He said, this isn`t out first rodeo. Ultimately, he relented on Friday night, he went back to New Jersey, he stayed on New Jersey on Saturday and Saturday night, and then by Sunday afternoon, he was back in New Hampshire. All day long today, Governor Christie has faced criticism that he basically left his state in the lurch in terms of the response to the storm, that he shouldn`t have rushed back to New Hampshire so soon. That the state, particularly the parts of the Jersey shore that flooded, they still need him and should be there taking care of business instead of running his distant campaign for president up in New Hampshire. Governor Christie has been parrying those criticisms from reporters and people at New Hampshire town halls all day. But, tonight, he appears to have lost his cool a little bit, lost his ability to handle the question with any degree of civility. And this very, very, very nervous young woman dared to put the question to him tonight. He blew up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, so I actually went to school in New Jersey. I have a lot of friends – GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bless you. Where in New Jersey? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pennington. CHRISTIE: All right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Pennington – CHRISTIE: Yes, ma`am? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, I actually had a quick question. With a lot of family and friend still living there, they had me ask you, why are you here in New Hampshire campaigning instead of there helping, serving the damages done by the coastal flooding from the storm? CHRISTIE: Well, because it`s already done. It`s already done. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. CHRISTIE: Tell me why you think it isn`t? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have friends, family calling and sending me videos and pictures – CHRISTIE: Where? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: – all over the state – CHRISTIE: All over the state? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: – of flooding. CHRISTIE: All over the state? Really? There`s been one county that is flooded in the state. One county. That was Cape May County. It`s the one county that flooded. So, I don`t know from all over the state since we have 21 counties where that`s happened. Second, I don`t see what you expect me to do. Do you want me to go down there with a mop? (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Want me to go down there with a mop? Governor Christie yelling at a nervous girl tonight in New Hampshire. After that happened tonight, the governor got some very, very good news for his campaign. “The Boston Herald”, it is, as the name implies, based in Boston. But “The Boston Herald” is very widely read in New Hampshire, particularly in the heavily populated southern part of New Hampshire. And “The Boston Herald” tonight just issued its endorsement in the Republican presidential primary this year, and they have given their endorsement to Chris Christie. They say, quote, “Governor Chris Christie is a smart and principled candidate with a real shot at uniting his party and broadening its appeal in November”, so says “The Boston Herald” tonight. You want him to go down there with a mop? I told you this is when stuff starts to get weird. We`ve got a lot ahead tonight. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIE: There`s been one county that is flooded in the state. One county. That was Cape May County. It`s a county that`s flooded. So, I don`t know where from all over the state, since we have 21 counties, where that`s happened. Second, I don`t see what you expect me to do. You want me to go down there with a mop? (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in New Hampshire today asking sarcastically if he should clean up the storm damage in his state with a mop. Accidentally, I think there were two counties in New Jersey that flooded. Not just the one. But that sarcastic retort tonight to a nervous young woman who`s asking question, that was right before Governor Christie got the news that “The Boston Herald” newspaper has just endorsed him in the Republican primary for president. “The Boston Herald”, obviously, based in Massachusetts but it`s widely read in New Hampshire, particularly Southern New Hampshire, population center in the state. So, that endorsement tonight is a big get for Chris Christie. That said, the other major Boston paper, which is widely read in New Hampshire, particularly in southern New Hampshire, is “The Boston Globe.” And tonight, “The Boston Globe” has just released their presidential endorsement as well, and they have picked not Chris Christie, but instead John Kasich. Both Chris Christie and John Kasich have hinged their campaigns for president on New Hampshire. They`re both all in in New Hampshire. They`re both looking for exactly this kind of establishment boost to their prospects. It will be interesting to see if “The Boston Herald” and “The Boston Globe” endorsements do have an impact in the polls for Christie and Kasich in New Hampshire. Now, in Iowa, the equivalent of “The Boston Herald” and “The Globe” rolled up into one and based inside the state is “The Des Moines Register”. And this weekend, “The Des Moines Register” endorsed in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. They picked Hillary Clinton for their Democratic endorsement. And for their Republican endorsement, interestingly, they picked Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio is running basically third in Iowa behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Broadly speaking, Senator is in that position nationwide, third place as well. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are really far out ahead in the polls in Iowa. But in what I think was a genius political move by each of them, both of these candidates, both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz decided that they would not even try for “The Des Moines Register” newspaper endorsement. Each of these candidates, in fact, refused to meet with the editorial board from “The Des Moines Register.” So, they weren`t even in the running for the endorsement. And that has two genius political consequences. Number one, it means that neither can be faulted for not winning the endorsement. They weren`t competing for it. And number two, it sort of devalues the endorsement that Marco Rubio did get from the paper because it makes him look like he`s the establishment guy who wanted the paper to like him and who bothered competing for something that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump wouldn`t have wanted even if they had gotten it. Ah! The race is so weird this year. I love it. Joining us now is Jason Noble, political reporter for “The Des Moines Register”. Mr. Noble, it`s great to see you. Thanks for being here. JASON NOBLE, THE DES MOINES REGISTER POLITICAL REPORTER: Hi, Rachel. Thanks for having me. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Exactly, one week out from the caucuses, is there something you can see from close up that we can`t necessarily see from a national level in terms of who is doing a good job organizing? NOBLE: No, I think you nailed it. This looks like it`s a two-man race. You know, you noted the polling here with Donald Trump. He`s opened up a bit of a lead. But Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are way ahead of the rest of the pack. We`re looking at the fascinating dynamic between the two of them as being decisive going into week out from the caucuses. You`ve got Donald Trump very sort of non-traditional candidate attracting a non-traditional following in Iowa. And the question is whether he`s going to be able to turn those people out. You`ve got Ted Cruz who is a very much a traditional Iowa candidate and has really drawn a lot of support, a lot of official support from social conservatives, evangelicals but has faced some of the head winds you mentioned with the comments from our governor and the beating that he`s taken from Donald Trump. ', 'MADDOW:', ' On that point about Governor Branstad – obviously, Governor Branstad is sort of a figure without parallel in other states. I mean, not only is he the longest serving governor in history, six different four-year terms. But also it`s Iowa. So, he knows not only how the state works, but he knows how the state functions in national politics. Do you think it is an influential thing? Do you think it has had an impact on the race for him to come out and make this extraordinary statement that Iowa Republicans should vote for anybody who`s not named Ted Cruz? NOBLE: We`re really going to have to wait to see. You know, he`s speaking very parochially. He`s thinking about the business and economic interest of the state. Obviously, the ag industry and biofuel industry is very important here. That`s interest that he was representing. That is a big force within politics here, within Republican politics here. The counter-weight within the Republican Party would be the social conservatives and evangelicals that are Ted Cruz`s base. We`ll see, eventually, to find out how much that takes the edge off of Cruz`s support here given his base is with social conservatives. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Jason Noble, political reporter for “The Des Moines Register” – Jason, thanks a lot. It`s nice to have you here. NOBLE: Thank you, Rachel. ', 'MADDOW:', ' One of the interesting things I will tell you about Iowa caucuses this year, again, one week from tonight. It`s just going to be – that`s just going to be seeing whether or not they are as chaotic this year on the Republican side as they were in 2012. People forget that 2012 was complete chaos on the Republican side. And we still never found out who won. I`m sort of looking forward to seeing if they`ve got their act together as much as I`m looking forward to seeing who`s going to do well. Stay with us. Lots more ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Imagine what it feels like to be parent right now living in Flint, Michigan. Specifically, imagine what it feels like being the parent of a kid enrolled at local elementary school like Brownell-Holmes STEM Academy. It`s one of three Flint schools where initial screenings back in October found the water levels at the school testing above 15 parts per billion for lead, which means the lead levels at the school were exceeding federal safety guidelines. A follow up investigation by the state after those initial October readings, excuse me, found that 12 of the 23 drinking fountains and faucets in one of the school`s buildings, so drinking fountains and faucets that you see here used for drinking but also used for cooking and food prep for the kids in the school cafeteria, almost half this had led parts exceeding 15 parts per billion. Some samples even tested as high as 166 parts per billion which is more than 10 times the threshold that is supposed to set off alarms in terms of federal standards for lead exposure. Imagine finding that out, right, about that school if you`re parent of a kid at that school, how that must feel knowing that you`re sending your kid there every day. Well, the way the schools have reacted is part of the unsung part of this story. The way the schools have reacted will surprise you when you hear this story, and that is one of the stories we`re going to be talking about on Wednesday night. We`re going to be doing the show from Flint, holding a town hall meeting on the lead poisoning crisis in that city. We`re actually going the hold that meeting at the Brownell-Holmes STEM Academy. That school I was just describing. It`s a town hall, Wednesday night. It`s called “American Disaster: The Crisis In Flint”. It`s going to be airing here 9:00 Wednesday. We`ll be broadcasting from that school. Cannot wait. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' This is the most recent cover of “Time Magazine”. It shows a 2- year-old from Flint, Michigan whose skin is covered in rash. The rashes that he`s got, his family believes them to be a result of him bathing in that city`s lead poison water. The woman who took this picture of this little 2-year-old kid is photographer for “The Detroit Free Press”. Her name is Regina Boon. Getting a “Time Magazine” cover is a big deal for any photographer. But Regina Boon is really, really good, and she`s done some amazing photos in terms of what`s going on in Flint. And on this story, to have it be a local paper`s photographer getting the cover shot, that`s just – it`s good. That`s really good. Another one of “The Detroit Free Press`s” excellent photographers who`s done really good work on the story is named Ryan Garza. Ryan Garza did an amazing photo essay. These are the images from it. He did it at a free clinic held this weekend in downtown Flint. Now, this clinic was sponsored by Herb Sanders, who`s a Detroit area lawyer who put on the event to help test local residents for high levels of lead. They were offering blood tests for lead levels. Oh, my God, did people turn out, lines out the door and out the building. Ryan Garza`s photos from this event are just heart wrenching. This one is of 3-year-old Kaden who is getting a blood test and screaming while the sample is being taken. The man holding him is his grandfather. And the next photograph in the series shows the grandfather wiping away his own tears after seeing what his little grandson went through. The doors to this clinic didn`t open until 10:00 a.m. on Saturday this weekend. But there was already a line of people waiting to get in an hour and a half before that. By 8:30 a.m., there was already a line for when the doors opened at 10:00. Two hours in after they opened the doors, volunteers had to start turning residents away because they had run out of testing kits. That`s how great the demand was to get tested. This ongoing story out of Flint is producing, among other things, some visuals that you just can`t believe, including some very unexpected visuals from these folks. If you were to stumble upon the Facebook page for the Genesee County Volunteer Militia, you see a lot of photos like this one. This is, yes, an arm chair constructed out of rifles and ammunition. Here is another, “In case of tyranny, break glass.” I think it`s some sort of AR-15 back there. There`s a lot of memes on the militia`s Facebook page. This one says, “freedom fries”, but as you can see, the French fries container is chockfull of big bullets. You might very well expect this kind of thing from a militia`s Facebook page. But if you do follow them on Facebook, you might have noticed their photo stream has taken an unexpected turn as of late, because starting last week, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia has been in Flint handing out bottled water alongside the American Red Cross. On Sunday, the group gathered at Flint city hall and it might have seemed like a militia Second Amendment rally with the armed people gathered wearing camo and folks waving flags, “Don`t Thread on Me” flags, the militia was actually there to demand accountability over the ongoing lead poisoning water crisis in Flint. Afterwards, the group handed out cases of water to Flint residents from the back of their trucks. One of the bright spots, unusual moments in the crisis, is that it has really brought together groups you might not expect would otherwise be allies. It happened in a small way this weekend with the militia. These are two brothers Lamont and Nate Williams. They are from Chicago and they traveled from the south side of Chicago to Flint this weekend to help respond to the crisis. They just gathered water donations on their own from people they knew and brought the donations to Flint on their own. They`re not affiliated with anybody. They just came the two brothers. It turns out they ended up chatting with members of the Genesee County Volunteer Militia while on a water run for the local Walmart. So they, too, ended up speaking at the militia rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAMONT WILLIAMS: I am overjoyed to see everybody out here supporting this city. I`m from Chicago, the south side of Chicago. In is my little brother Nate. We drove up here by ourselves. We`re not a part of any organization. We don`t represent anything other than humans need water. And people coming together in times of crisis. (APPLAUSE) With that being said, we drove up here with a couple of donations from friends and family but mostly out of our own pockets. We made about four or five trips to Walmart. We handed out over a hundred cases to families at the fire station on MLK Avenue and Crosby. We`re trying to do our part. I know when I go back home and tell my story and Nate tells his story to friends and family we`ll be back and in will be more the next time. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I want to say Chicago is with you, and I`m just so happy to have met all the wonderful people of Flint. You`ve been nothing but kind since we`ve been here. We want to help out. (CHEERS) (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Unity. There was some unexpected unity, some new alliances outside Flint city hall this weekend. But unity on how best to tackle the crisis. Unity in terms of purpose, unity of purpose in terms of how to get it done. How to fix the problem overall. That turns out to be severely lacking now. You`ll never guess who the culprit is. Actually, you`ll guess who the culprit is. But that story is next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' This is a letter sent to the state of Michigan late last week by the federal government. The Obama administration specifically, the EPA, sent Michigan this 18-page letter. It was essentially a list of things that the state has to do and soon to address the lead poisoning crisis in Flint. The letter says within five days, the Snyder administration has to create a website where they post the water testing results, all their testing plans, all of their weekly status reports. Within 10 days the Snyder administration has to hand over the lead testing results for Flint for the last three years. Within ten days they have to hand over an inventory with service lines that are made out of lead. They have to hand over the information in Excel or a similar format, which should be hilarious given that the last system Flint used to catalog the location of its old lead pipe was this drawer full of tens of thousands of handwritten index cards. But now, the EPA wants it in spread sheet form. This order from the EPA went to the state of Michigan on Thursday. This is not a list of recommendations. This is the federal government saying to Michigan, you are here by ordered to perform the following tasks and you were ordered to complete them by specific deadlines set forth in this order. So, the state of Michigan received this order from the EPA last week and the Snyder administration, which created the disaster, the Rick Snyder administration responded to the EPA by saying, basically, “Got your letter. Thank you for writing. But we really don`t think you are the right to tell us what to do.” Governor Rick Snyder`s administration was legally obligated to respond to the EPA within one day of receiving the order. And they did. But the response from his administration to this very specific, very detailed federal order reads in part, quote, “We question whether the EPA has the legal authority to order a state and its agencies to take the actions outlined in this order.” So, the Snyder administration caused this disaster. They know they did. They admit they did. And now, as if the city of Flint isn`t dealing with enough, thanks to them, now the Snyder administration is telling the federal government to back off and stop telling them what to do. Leave it to them to sort it out. Well, that response from the state came on Friday night. We can now report that the federal government has responded back. The Feds have written back a one page, one paragraph letter to the state of Michigan telling them that not only does the EPA have the legal authority but Michigan better step on it. The state must, quote, “immediately commence and continue work to meet the obligations as ordered.” The EPA says state officials must comply and they expect, quote, “full implementation of the order.” One page, one paragraph. Feds to Michigan, get moving. Joining us now is Bryn Mickle. He`s editor of “The Flint Journal”, which has been muckraking fearlessly and advocating fiercely for their town throughout this crisis. Mr. Mickle, it`s nice to have you with us again tonight. Thanks for being here. BRYN MICKLE, FLINT JOURNAL EDITOR: Thank you for having me. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the Snyder administration is responding to the federal government, in part, by pushing back against the EPA and saying you have no right to tell us what to do. Is that boilerplate? Should we have expected that? MICKLE: I don`t think we should have expected it. I think, at this point, actions speak louder than words. We`ve heard a lot of apologies, but we haven`t seen much in the form of action. And the idea they are spending time of arguing with the EPA instead of developing plan to replace the lead lines is mind-boggling. You know, this is energy better directed at solving the problem. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Last week, President Obama said he would speed $80 million to Michigan. The initial response, was yes, you got $5 million to help and then he said while he was in Detroit for the auto show and talking to the conference of mayors said we`re going to get $80 million to Michigan. The White House strongly suggesting the money should go toward the crisis. Do we actually know if Governor Snyder to commit to using that $80 million for Flint? MICKLE: No. My last communication on Friday and I was told flat out that they were evaluating all of their options. It seemed pretty clear to me that the intent of the president was for that money to go toward the Flint crisis. I don`t think it was any coincidence that he announced it in connection with Flint. But I was told, no, we`re studying the issue. And again, you know, this is the governor that right now is hiring PR firms. Where are the engineering firms? You know, let`s get the lead lines dug up and replaced. There`s no time to wait on this. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Your newspaper, “The Flint Journal”, has called for Governor Snyder to release all of his e-mails in the crisis. He`s posted his e- mails from two years of the crisis, 2013 – 2014 and 2015, excuse me. He hasn`t posted anything from this year and he hasn`t posted anything from 2013 or before. Why did your paper call for those extra years? Those additional years to have – to be disclosed by the governor? MICKLE: To be honest. To see what else was going on as far as what communications there were prior. It was really surprising when we got the e-mails and there was only a handful that were actually written by the governor. You know, transparency – saying it is great – but clearly, there`s more information out here. Maybe it`s in the form of text messages. Maybe it`s in form of e-mails from earlier, but more needs to be released here. I would encourage the governor to reconsider his idea of keeping secret the communications by his staffers, by his appointees. This information needs to come out. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Bryn Mickle, editor of “The Flint Journal”, thank you. Again, I`ve said this before, but thank you for your paper`s work on this and thanks for helping understand what`s going on tonight. I appreciate you for being here. MICKLE: Well, thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Thanks. For the record, we asked Governor Snyder`s office again today for his e- mails about Flint water from 2013 and from 2016 this year and that we`ve also asked him for his e-mails from 2012. We want 2012, 2013 and 2016 to go along with the other two years they have released. The governor`s office has not responded to our request. But Michigan Radio supports that subpoenas in a class action lawsuit have gone off. These plaintiffs are suing over the Flint water disaster and they are asking for those documents and more from Rick Snyder`s office and from the emergency managers that the governor put in charge of Flint. We don`t know if they`re going to get those records and the messages they are seeking from the Snyder administration, but they`re trying. They are taking it to the courts. We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`re going to back in a moment with a story I cannot report. There is news to report on this story, but I cannot report it, because basically one Republican governor`s office has gone completely absolutely nuts. This is so strange. This is the weirdest interaction we`ve had with a sitting governor since Mark Sanford disappeared and said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail when he was secretly in Argentina stooping someone who wasn`t his wife. This is the weirdest thing with a governor`s office we have had since Mark Sanford went missing, but it explains why I can`t tell you what`s about to happen in one American state. And that story, the whole weird tale of it, is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. PAUL LEPAGE (R), MAINE: Now the traffickers, these are people that take drugs. These are the people named D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty. These types of guys that come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin and then they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Maine Governor Paul LePage. He later explained he had nothing to apologize for in those remarks because after all, Maine is very white. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEPAGE: I was going impromptu and my brain didn`t watch up to my mouth. Instead of saying Maine women. I said white women. I`m not going to apologize to the Maine women for that, because if you go to Maine, you will see that we`re essentially 95 percent white. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' We are super white, you guys. No harm, no foul. I mean, who was offended? Maine Governor Paul LePage is an unusual kind of governor and that means under Governor Paul LePage`s leadership, the state of Maine makes unusual kind of news. When we last left Maine Governor LePage in the wake of his D-Money impregnating a white girl comments, Maine was on the eve of a big debate in their legislature over whether or not he would be impeached on abuse of power allegations. That effort took up a good chunk of the legislature`s time a couple weeks ago. Ultimately, it went nowhere, though. Democrats and the leadership joined Republicans to postpone the Paul LePage impeachment effort indefinitely. When the impeachment effort fell apart, Governor LePage called the whole thing, quote, “foolishness.” But he also left an open question that`s of significant consequence for his state, because in the days before the impeachment debate the governor had threatened that he would skip his annual state of the state address. He decided that if the legislature wanted to impeach him, then he just wasn`t going to do that thing this year. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) LEPAGE: Why am I going to go up and face people and talk to them in an audience that just a day – you know, a week or two before they`re trying to impeach me? That`s just silliness. So why don`t we just I`ll go to work, keep working, I`ll send them a letter and call it a day. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Governor Paul LePage doesn`t want to give the state of the state this year. Not if it means talking in person to the legislature that just debated impeaching him. He raised the prospect that he might skip the whole speech this year, submit it in writing instead. But then the impeachment thing fell apart and now, we`re left with this interesting open question. Since it turns out you`re not being impeached, Governor, is the speech back on or are you still literally going to mail it in for Maine`s state of the state this year? Simple question. We reached out to the governor`s office to ask. And I`ve got to tell you, we do this kind of thing all day long, getting basic information from all different kinds of public officials. This is what we do. This is a normal thing. This is what we sent, “Hi. Hi. Wanted to see if the governor`s made a decision about whether or not he`ll give the state of the state address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter. Do you have any information on that decision yet? Thanks!” Simple question to the governor`s office, right? This was the response we got from Paul LePage`s office. Look at this. This is the whole thing. Quote, “Why does Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage? Her neurotic fixation on him is kind of bizarre.” (LAUGHTER) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That was the response from the governor`s office. That was the whole thing. It`s very strange. So, we tried again, “Is this seriously your response? Should we take this to mean that the governor has not made up his mind?” Response from Paul LePage`s office. “It`s a serious question. Does Rachel have ties to Maine? If not, what`s her weird fascination with him?” So, that`s a no? We tried again. “Hi. I`m going to try one more time on our question about Governor LePage`s state of the state this year. Has he made a decision whether he will give the state of the state address in person or if he will send a letter instead? We really are just looking for an answer to that question. If you can`t answer it is there someone else we can try to speak with? Thanks very much.” Governor`s response, quote, “Of course, I can answer it. But you first. What`s with Maddow`s obsession with the governor?” Admit it. At this point you`d start to be a little obsessed as well. So, we wrote back once more to the governor`s office. “This is becoming a strange interaction. We are just trying to get some basic information about a statement the governor made. We are covering this like we would any other newsmaker or public official in the country, or obsessiveness is only about the news. And Governor LePage is making it hard to get basic information about the governance of that state and that is starting to feel newsworthy too.” Response from the governor`s office. Bupkis. Nothing. So, seriously, I cannot tell you whether or not Maine is getting a state of the state address this year because the governor apparently finds it very offensive that I would even want to know. So, all I can tell you that the state of the state address usually takes place by early February, but apparently you`re a sicko if you want to know any more about it than that, so says the governor of that fine state. Just amazing. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Measuring snowfall is hard to do because gravity. As the snow piles up, as it accumulates, the weight of the snow on the top of the pile starts to press down and crush the snow at the bottom of the pile. So even if you drop a measuring stick into the ground and it says 30 inches, you`re likely waiting around in more than that because the last snowfall, right, is squishing down the early snowfall. Calculating snowfall accurately is a hard thing to do. And that is why the National Weather Service has developed a set of guidelines and a tool for measuring snow correctly, accounting for the gravity problem. And that tool, that highly specialized tool, is a board. No, seriously. It`s a board. There are so many great questions in life for which plywood is the answer. And this is one of them. At weather.gov, you can see some pictures of the specialized snow measuring board in action. Look at it go. Basically, you get your board and you get a measuring stick and you put your board in an area that is free of snow drifts. And every couple of hours you measure the accumulation on the board. Then you wipe it away. Then you essentially rinse and repeat throughout the storm. Once it stops snowing, you add up all of your measurements that you took over the course of the storm and presto change-o that is your total snowfall. Good system. It works. Simple, easy. It`s foolproof. Until it`s not. Reagan National Airport is where the official snowfall tally is taken for Washington, D.C. That`s where they use the official snow measuring board. And that`s where they take the measurement that gets reported to the National Weather Service. And that is the official spot from which we get a snow total for Washington, D.C. But this weekend, in the middle of that ridiculous storm this weekend, the good folks at Reagan National Airport who measure the snow, they lost the board. They lost it in the snow. Dropped it and then couldn`t find it. Folks at Reagan national had to improvise their calculations by measuring in a bunch of different areas and averaging out those numbers and now those flawed numbers stand as D.C.`s official snowfall measurement. Even though nearby official totals at Dulles Airport and BWI airport those are nearly a foot higher than those being reported from Reagan. They lost the snow-board. D.C. officially got 17.8 inches of snow this past weekend, which sounds like a lot. But that means, the storm did not officially crack the top three blizzards of all time in D.C. But maybe it was actually way more snow than that and we`ll never know, because they lost the board. They lost the board! Who knew snowfall measurement was even done with a board? Once Washington manages to dig the board out at Reagan Airport, I would like to suggest maybe they tie a little leash to it, maybe handcuff it to the snow-board wrangler for the duration of the storm next time? I`m sorry, D.C. Your storm was probably bigger than they say it was. I know you say that to all – never mind. All right. That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.   ']\n",
      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 22, 2016 Guest: Lindsey Smith, Linda Lee ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining with us this hour. Happy weekend. Happy Friday. OK, this goes in an unexpected place but trust me, you`re going to enjoy the ride. In May 2008, John McCain had all but wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. At that point, it was basically just a march to the convention for him. But sometimes candidates hit obstacles in their campaigns that weren`t put there by their opponents. It`s not because one of their rivals for the nomination or a candidate from another party has hit them with something particularly hard. Sometimes, candidates just make their own unforced errors. And John McCain did that in the spring of 2008 when he momentarily hopped into bed with a sort of high-profile guy who it turned out had very, very strong and strongly stated beliefs about among other things the Catholic Church. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HAGEE, TEXAS PASTOR: This is the great whore of Revelations 17. This is the antichrist system. This is the apostate church. God says the day is going to come when I`m going to cause this beast to devour this apostate system. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That man`s name is John Hagee, a Texas pastor who preaches that the Catholic Church is the whore of Babylon that will be devoured by the antichrist. He also claimed that the great whore, aka the Catholic Church, drinks the blood of the Jewish people. John Hagee in the spring of 2008 endorsed Senator John McCain for president. And John McCain initially was psyched. He appeared with Pastor Hagee to accept his endorsement in person. He thanked him in person for the endorsement. He basically campaigned on that endorsement. But if the Catholic Church being the whore of Babylon wasn`t enough to sour that blossoming political alliance, eventually this part of John Hagee`s public life made the whole thing slightly untenable for Senator McCain. Do we have this clip from John Hagee? Oh, I think we`ll have it in just a second. This is – well, OK. Go ahead. Go for it. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HAGEE: God sent a hunter. A hunter is someone who comes with a gun. And he forces you. Hitler was a hunter. How did it happen? Because God allowed it to happen. Why did it happen? Because God said my top priority for the Jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' God sent Hitler. God sent Hitler. Well, John McCain could apparently endure some of the other things that Pastor John Hagee was known to have said about the Catholic Church and other topics. Pastor Hagee, for example, also blamed Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans having once hosted a gay pride parade. God sent the hurricane to New Orleans to punish them for gay people existing in public in that city. But when John Hagee said that the Nazis were doing God`s work, that Hitler was sent by God to kill the Jews, that was kind of a harder sell. And so, in May of 2008 John McCain, having accepted the endorsement and campaigned on the endorsement from John Hagee, he had to retroactively reject John Hagee`s endorsement and endure a few days worth of headlines like these, “McCain rejects Hagee backing as not (INAUDIBLE)” So, that was one bump on the road to John McCain being nominated as the Republican Party`s candidate in 2008. And honestly, you know what, candidates cannot be held responsible for everything said and done and believed by people who like them and endorse them and vote for them, right? But that`s why the Hagee debacle was such an unforced error on the part of John McCain. It would be one thing if John Hagee had just endorsed John McCain and John McCain had nothing to do with him, then he wouldn`t be responsible for vetting Pastor John Hagee and make sure that he didn`t, for example, think Hitler was doing God`s work. John McCain`s screw-up in 2008 was that he overtly welcomed the endorsement. And appeared with the guy and campaigned on the endorsement. And once you do that, you kind of own it, which somebody should explain sometime very soon to Texas Senator Ted Cruz. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MIKE BICKLKE, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PRAYER FOUNDER: Let me tell you, these 20 – less than 20 million Jews worldwide. God is going to bring them all back. The Lord says I`m going to offer two strategies to Israel, to these 20 million. He says, first I`m going to offer them grace. I`m going to send the fisherman. Do you know how a fisherman lures? I mean, do you know how a fisherman does their thing? They have the bait in front, luring the fish. It`s a picture of grace. The hunters are opposite. Instead of luring them in front, hunters drive with fear from behind. The Lord says, I`m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fisherman. I`m going to give them grace. I`m going to give them grace. And he says that if they don`t respond to grace, I`m going to raise up the hunters. And the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolf Hitler. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here we are again. God sent Hitler to chase the Jews. Now, that is not the guy who famously had to be renounced by John McCain in 2008. That wasn`t John Hagee who you just heard there. That`s a different guy. His name is Mike Bickle. And the Ted Cruz campaign just put out an excited statement proclaiming the Ted Cruz endorsement from Pastor Mike Bickle. Look, presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced the endorsement of Mike Bickle, founder and director of the International House of Prayer of Kansas City. Quote, “Heidi and I,” this is in Ted Cruz`s voice, “Heidi, my wife and I are grateful to have Mike`s prayers and supports. With the support of Mike and many people of faith, we will fight the good fight, finish the course, and keep the faith.” Part of what Mike Bickle teaches at his version of IHOP, the international house of not pancakes but prayer, is that God sent Hitler to chase the Jews, the Nazis were doing God`s work. Mike Bickle also famously says he can see in the United States today harbingers of the antichrist. Things that tell you the antichrist is coming. And you`d never believe who he thinks is the most nefarious one. Spoiler alert: It`s not President Obama. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: The harlot of Babylon is preparing the nations to receive the antichrist. The harlot of Babylon will be the religion of affirmation, toleration, no absolutes, a counterfeit justice movement. They will be sincere, many of them, but their sincerity will not in any way lessen the impact of their deception. The fact that they are sincere does not make their deception less damaging. I believe that one of the main pastors as a forerunner to the harlot movement, it`s not a movement yet, is Oprah. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Who? Oprah. Oprah Winfrey, harbinger of the antichrist. Seems unlikely, right? But that`s the whole point. Seems so unlikely. That`s how she does it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: Oprah. She is winsome. She is kind. She is reasonable. She is utterly deceived. Utterly deceived. A classy woman. A cool woman. A charming woman. But has a spirit of deception. And she`s one of the clear pastors, forerunners to the harlot movement. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That is who just gave a presidential endorsement to Ted Cruz. And that is the guy who Ted Cruz put out the official campaign statement proclaiming the endorsement thanking Pastor Mike Bickle for the endorsement. Ted Cruz is now campaigning on his support from this guy who says that Oprah is the harbinger of the antichrist, first reported by people for the American Way. And it will be interesting to see if the Republican Party has changed enough since 2008, right? Even though John McCain couldn`t endure holding on to this endorsement in 2008 from a guy who said that God sent Hitler to come hunt the Jews. That was not sustainable in Republican Party politics in 2008. It will be interesting to see if eight years later in 2016, Ted Cruz can stand to proclaim and welcome and be proud of the endorsement of a guy who said the exact same thing, that God sent Hitler to hunt the Jews, it was God`s will. That will be interesting to watch. Even just over this weekend. To see if Ted Cruz has to walk back his excited statement of support from the guy who says that Hitler was God`s Jew hunter. Whether or not that happens, though, this endorsement from Mike Bickle of Ted Cruz and his proclaiming of it, it also offers an interesting new angle on the fast escalating fight between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump on the campaign trail because it turns out one weird front of battle between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump is Oprah Winfrey. And you think I`m kidding, I know. But I`m not, because it`s very clear. Here`s Ted Cruz`s guy whose endorsement Ted Cruz is now campaigning on. Here`s what he thinks about Oprah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BICKLE: One of the main pastors as a forerunner to the harlot movement. It`s not the harlot movement yet. It`s Oprah. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oprah. How you know the antichrist is on his way. That`s Ted Cruz`s guy. That`s how Oprah functions in the Ted Cruz for president campaign. Here is how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign. Here`s how Oprah functions in the Donald Trump for president campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT LAUER, TODAY SHOW: Running mate. If you decide to go with this, who would be the ideal running mate for Donald Trump? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, I think Oprah would be great. LAUER: Seriously. TRUMP: I think that – probably that would be serious, actually. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That was Donald Trump the first time he flirted with running for president in the 2000 presidential campaign. He volunteered apropos of nothing that he was considering Oprah Winfrey to be his vice presidential running mate that year if he in fact mounted a bid for the presidency which he didn`t. That was the only name he ever floated as a possible vice president in the 2000 campaign. That wasn`t like people were asking him, “Hey, everybody likes Oprah, you`re friendly with Oprah, shouldn`t Oprah be your running mate?” No, he just brought it up. Vice president Oprah. That was a long time ago. That would have been the presidential campaign in the year 2000. But apparently, he is still thinking along those lines this time around. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Back in 1999 when you were thinking as the reform party candidate you told Larry King that you`d consider Oprah for vice president. TRUMP: I like Oprah. What can I tell you? INTERVIEWER: Still on your short list? TRUMP: She`s great. She`s talented. She`s a friend of mine. She`s a good person. I`ve been on her show. In fact I was on her show the last week. She said, could I be on her show with the whole family. I like Oprah. Is that supposed to be a bad thing? INTERVIEWER: No. The kind of people you`re going to run – TRUMP: Oprah would be great. I`d like to have Oprah. I think we`d win easily actually. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' In what is turning out to be kind of a Donald Trump-Ted Cruz death match at this stage in the 2016 presidential race one of the fronts of battle turns out to be Oprah Winfrey. It`s a pretty clear distinction, right? Harbinger of the antichrist or possible running mate. Choose. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump today also both broke new ground in their campaigns by unveiling straight up attack ads against each other. In terms of my assessment of these ads, I think they`re both about the same caliber, same quality, will have the same effect. I will say the anti-Trump ad by Ted Cruz does have one laugh out loud moment that I think you`re not supposed to laugh at. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) TRUMP: I`m Donald Trump, and I approve this message. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: It sounded like you wanted the bill to pass. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course, I wanted the bill to pass – my amendment to pass. What my amendment did – BAIER: You said the bill. CRUZ: – is take citizenship off the table. But it doesn`t mean – what it doesn`t mean that I supported the other aspects of the bill. I want immigration reform to pass. And it allows those who are here illegally to come in out of the shadows. BAIER: The amendment would have allowed undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. permanently and obtain legal status. So, how do you square this circle? CRUZ: Actually, Bret, it wouldn`t have. TRUMP: People want to take back their country. We want to do it in a humane way, but we have to have a country. We don`t have a country right now. We have people pouring in. They`re pouring in. And they`re doing tremendous damage. If you look at the crime, if you look at the economy, we want to have borders. To have a country you have to have borders. We don`t have borders right now. AD NARRATOR: Eminent domain – fancy term for politicians seizing private property to enrich the fat cats who bankroll them. Like Trump. TRUMP: I think eminent domain is wonderful. AD NARRATOR: It made him rich. Like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn`t have a heart. AD NARRATOR: Trump won`t change the system. He`s what`s wrong with it. CRUZ: I`m Ted Cruz, and I approve this message. (END VIDEO CLIPS) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both unveiling direct old school nasty style attack ads against each other today, ten days out from the Iowa caucuses. Neither of these candidates has spent very much money at all on advertisements thus far. They are both sitting on basically infinite funds. So, if Ted Cruz and Donald Trump decide to spend all of their infinite funds, throwing stuff like that at each other, the people of Iowa over these next ten days are going to be treating their TVs like a hazmat site, like not only are people not going to watch TV anymore, they`re going to throw blankets over their TVs just in case they wake themselves up and accidentally start showing that stuff and scaring the kids. Tonight, just as we were going to art FOX News Channel released their latest poll in the Republican presidential race. This is a national poll of Republican voters. What it shows is a very clear stratifying of the race. So, just look. This is a pretty good snapshot actually for this time of year. We`ll start at the bottom. At 1 percent, you`ve got Jim Gilmore and Carly Fiorina. Remember when Carly Fiorina was going to be a contender? Yes. At 2 percent, that`s Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, utterly unsustainable for those candidates. Rand Paul`s dad even did an interview with a conservative website this week in which he told the interviewer he`s pretty sure Donald Trump is going to beat his son and win the nomination. That could not have helped, dear old dad. Dad! That said, Ron Paul is expected to be out on the campaign trail with his Mr. 2 Percent Son. It will be Ron campaigning with Rand for the first time this year, first time this season. They`ll start this weekend. Up at 3 percent, it`s Chris Christie who just left the campaign trail in New Hampshire this afternoon to head back to New Jersey in the face of the oncoming blizzard. Tied for 4 percent nationwide it is John Kasich and Jeb Bush. The main difference between these two candidates right now is John Kasich has spent a total of about $11 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls and Jeb Bush has spent $59 million to get to 4 percent in the national polls. Unless Jeb Bush somehow pulls this out miraculously, he is going to be one of the most spectacularly expensive political failures of all time. So, that`s the lowest tier of candidates right now in national polling, according to this new FOX News polling that`s out tonight. Second tier has two candidates in it. Ben Carson is at 8 percent which is still low, but it`s double Jeb Bush. Marco Rubio is also in the second tier. He`s at 11 percent. On top of them, it`s the clear top tier of the Republican race indisputably now. Donald Trump is still way out ahead. He`s definitely the front- runner. He`s got 34 percent of the vote. The only guy up there with him at all anywhere near him is Ted Cruz with 20 percent. And so, it`s really starting to look like the race for the Republican nomination is a race between Donald Trump and just Ted Cruz. And frankly, if it comes down to that, I think we should let Oprah pick. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What are you doing Wednesday night? If you don`t have plans already, don`t make them. If you do have plans for Wednesday night already, how firm are they? We`ve got an announcement coming up in just a moment. We`re doing something on this show on Wednesday night. It`s something we have never done before. It`s kind of a big deal for us. That announcement is straight ahead. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the federal government, the EPA, has now issued an 18-page emergency order to the state of Michigan and it`s pretty stern and it`s pretty dire. Quote, “EPA does not have information that would provide any assurance that contamination in Flint`s water system has been controlled.” And then in this order, they order the Rick Snyder administration to get on it, fast. They give the state of Michigan a series of really short deadlines. Within five days, the Snyder administration has to create a website where it has to post all its water testing results, all its testing plans, all its weekly status reports. Within ten days, the Snyder administration has to finally answer all the questions it never answered the last time the EPA asked the state for information about the lead in Flint`s water, which was back in November. And if you`re wondering how many questions the EPA had back then, yes. Look. It was a lot. And the Snyder administration has not been able to answer those questions for two months. Now, they`re under an emergency order that they`ve got to produce those answers in ten days. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to submit water quality measurements from Flint including ph, alkalinity, orthophosphates, chloride, turbidity, iron, calcium, temperature conductivity – they have to measure all of those things at ten sites every week and hand over the results. Also within ten days, the Snyder administration has to hand in all their lead testing results for Flint from the past three years. And within three days, the Snyder administration has to give the EPA a list of the zip codes in Flint where the highest blood levels have been found. It`s going to be a busy few days responding to this, right? Oh, but wait, there`s more. Because also in that ten-day window the Snyder administration is now ordered to hand over an inventory of homes in Flint, houses in Flint that are connected to the city water lines with service lines that are made out of lead. And they need to hand over that lead pipe inventory in a very specific way. They have to hand it over, quote, “in Excel spreadsheet or a similar format.” And I know you might be thinking, OK, so Michigan has to hand over a lot of data to the EPA, it`s not that big a deal, they can just send over their spreadsheets with all of that information. Here`s the thing, though – consider just one of the things the EPA is asking for, this spreadsheet. Excel or similar, right? A spreadsheet listing all of the homes in Flint that get their water through lead service lines. It`s important to know where they lead service lines are because then you know where you most need to test the water for lead, and you have to know it because those are the lines that are going to have to be dug up and replaced now that the untreated Flint River water has corroded them so badly that they will constantly leach lead into the water no matter how clean the water is that`s getting pumped through them. These again are the service lines that connect people`s houses to the water mains in the street. Back in November when the state finally started taking Flint`s lead poisoning crisis seriously, the state asked the city of Flint for this information. Where are all the lead service lines in the city? The city could not answer that question back in November. And when the folks at Michigan radio went to the Flint records office themselves to try to get the information themselves, they found out why the city couldn`t answer. And it`s amazing. Because it turns out these are Flint`s records of its water lines – filing cabinets full of disorganized handwritten index cards from the last 100 years along with a couple of old torn-up maps, more than 40,000 handwritten index cards. This is it. Flint has been in the process of trying to organize these records with the help of the University of Michigan, but you can see why if the EPA said we need a spreadsheet with all your lead service lines on it, we need it within 10 days, you can see why that might be a problem. And we`re now finding out this evening that might not be the only problem – at least according to the Snyder administration. The EPA did tell us tonight that Michigan has stated that it is committed to complying with this order, it is committed to implementing these measures, these things the EPA is asking for, but we have now also learned that the head of Michigan`s environmental agency has written to the EPA to say that the state, the Snyder administration, is questioning the legality of this federal order, questioning whether the EPA has the authority to order the state to take all these steps. Two sides are promising to try to talk this out, but right now, it looks like this could turn into a standoff between Michigan and the EPA, which is just what Flint needs. Hold that thought. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, yesterday, the EPA, the federal government sent the Rick Snyder administration in Michigan an 18-page emergency order giving the state a list of things they have to do very quickly to start addressing the lead poisoning crisis in Flint. As we just mentioned, we have learned tonight that the Snyder administration is challenging the legality of that order from the federal government. One of the things the state is being ordered to do by the federal government is hand over a spreadsheet listing lead pipe service lines in the city of Flint. Michigan radio was first to report that – do we have this picture? That this is the existing data information system in Flint for where those lead pipes are. It`s tens of thousands of handwritten index cards. Joining us now is Lindsey Smith. She`s reporter for Michigan Radio. She and her colleagues there have been doing great work on this story. Lindsey, it`s really nice to have you here. Your reporting really has been indispensable. LINDSEY SMITH, MICHIGAN RADIO REPORTER: My pleasure. ', 'MADDOW:', ' What do you make of this letter we`re just learn about from the head of the state environmental agency saying we`ve spent all this money, we`ve done what you asked, and we don`t think you have the legal authority to order us to do anything. Is that just the expected response when something like this happens? SMITH: I – you know, I think the letter said there are some facts and omissions that the EPA they`re saying is maybe not clear about in their response that they have done so far. I think the thing to note is the state has really in the last two weeks changed some major direction in how they`ve tried to handle this crisis, bringing in the National Guard, bringing in the state police, switching from just having water distribution sites to going door to door. So, I assume they will try to make the case that they have been trying to do everything they can to adequately protect public health, which is what the EPA`s order, this emergency order, says that they have not been able to do so far. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In terms of what the EPA is asking for or telling the Snyder administration they need to do, from what you`ve reported about how information is managed in Flint and what`s known about the systems there, thinking specifically about this deadline where they have to tell them where all the lead service lines are in all of the – for all of the homes in Flint, does it seem conceivable to you that the state could get that information together in electronic spreadsheet form within ten days? SMITH: They – I know they`re working on it. I`ll give you that. We really – I think this came to light in the course of this crisis because you do have to test for homes with lead service lines, at least 50 percent of your sampling pool is supposed to be from these homes because those are really the worst case scenario. That`s where the lead is going to show up first if you`re not treating the water properly, which is what happened in Flint. And when we realized that the records weren`t really in good order, we approached the state with that information, myself and other reporters, and said, you know, you dropped these two high lead samples for technical reasons, but you didn`t really look at the overall sample pool to make sure that the city of Flint was getting samples that they were supposed to from houses with lead service lines. And they – it was very shortly after some of those reports started coming out that the state sent the letter to Flint that you mentioned earlier saying, hey, you need to give us this information. Even before then the University of Michigan`s Flint campus had announced that they would be working with the city of Flint to try to make an electronic database as best they could. But talking to water officials in Flint, a lot of that is in their – a lot of the records or a lot of the things they know about the water system and not everything. I`m not trying to over-exaggerate this. But the guy told me a lot of this is in my memory, it`s in my head. We`ve worked here for a long time, so we know these things. So, they`re going to have to take these different databases they have, the index cards, the maps, and arguably what`s in the guys` heads and try to come up with a way to map the city as best they can. In November, they wanted to get that done by early February was the earliest they had told us they were going to be able to get that done. But I think once the state stepped in and said you need to get this to us there was a pedal to the metal push. So, I don`t know if they`re going to be able to pull it off or not. I think that`s some of the things we`re asking right now. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And the federal government pressure certainly is going to add to the pressure. But it remains to be seen what their capacity is. Lindsey Smith, reporter for Michigan Radio, really appreciate your time tonight in helping us with this story. And again, Michigan Radio has done seminal work on this story so far. It`s been indispensable for us trying to follow it at the national level. So, thank you. SMITH: My pleasure. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Thank you. I should also tell you, if we can go back there for a second. Thank you very much. I should also tell you that Michigan Radio`s documentary on this disaster in Flint is going to be airing on public radio stations across the country this weekend. You should check your public radio station listings for this. The documentary is called “Not Safe to Drink.” Again, check your local listings. They`re really, really good on this story. You owe it to yourself to hear this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' For the first seven-plus years that I had this show I could not get a Clinton on this show to save my life. I asked in the context of the 2008 campaign. I asked in the context of Hillary Clinton`s time as secretary of state. I asked in the context of her stepping down as secretary of state. I asked in a whole bunch of circumstances for an interview with former President Bill Clinton. I said I would travel, I said I would pretape, I`d do it live, anything. No dice. No Clintons for more than seven years. But then, tick, tick, tick, tick, ding. Something happened. A bell went off somewhere that allowed the circumstance to change. And now, during this presidential campaign over the last few weeks, I have had several opportunities to interview Secretary Clinton, which has been super helpful for our ability to cover this race. It`s been great. But in the first interview that I had with Secretary Clinton we had never met before after seven years of me asking for an interview. There was one question in that first interview that led to a little flurry of right-wing criticism at the time. And now today that issue is back. But in a very unexpected way. Here was the exchange I`m talking about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One policy question that I think the Republicans are raising, they`re talking about amongst themselves – hasn`t really burst into a general election conversation yet, but I`m genuinely shocked by it. Which is it`s becoming sort of fashionable in Republican circles to talk about abolishing the V.A., privatizing the V.A., getting rid of it. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Throwing veterans onto the mercies of the for profit health care system. The reason they`re able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the V.A. seem so intractable. If I had been running a Republican campaign against President Obama last year, I would have run it entirely on the V.A. A bureaucracy, a bloated big government program that can`t be fixed and let`s do right by our veterans. CLINTON: Mm-hmm. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you – do you have any new ideas for trying to fix it? You can`t find a person in politics who doesn`t say we shouldn`t do right by our veterans. But for some reason, this can`t get fixed fast enough. CLINTON: Yes. And I don`t understand that. You know, I don`t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans. And overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Much more so than people in the regular system. CLINTON: That`s exactly right. No one would believe that from the coverage you see and the constant berating of the V.A. that comes from Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, in part because there has been real scandal. CLINTON: There has been. But it`s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It has not been as widespread as it has been made out to be. Secretary Clinton went on to say that the V.A. needed to be reformed, she had specific things that she wanted to see changed to improve the V.A. But that comment, that part of her response about how widespread the problems were, that turned into like red alert, all caps, get out your fax machine hysteria on the right for about five minutes. Republicans professed to be very upset with that specific way that she characterized the problems at the V.A. despite everything else she said. Clearly, they said she was underplaying the terribleness of the V.A., she was apologizing for the V.A. when they implied the only right thing to say about the V.A. is that it should be condemned wholesale. And that little revolt on the right after that interview, that turned out to be a really instructive moment because there has been something quietly brewing on the right in the Republican Party, mostly under the radar but it bubbled up in that moment with Hillary Clinton in that interview, and it is coming up again right now for a completely backwards, opposite reason. And that story`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One of the weird things about presidential politics this year is that almost to a person, the entire Republican presidential field this year is totally on board with abolishing the V.A., getting rid of the V.A. or at least privatizing huge swaths of it, telling veterans they`re not going to be provided medical care anymore, they can go get it themselves. So, when veterans get off the plane and come home from war, just set them loose into the private health insurance market to fend for themselves. Thanks for your service, good luck with that, here`s a coupon. This used to be a very radical idea. When Mitt Romney dipped his toe into the “privatize the V.A.” pool back in 2012, he got it chomped off so fast that he abandoned the idea immediately and basically never spoke of it again. But this year hasn`t been that long, only four years later, and this year almost the entire Republican field is in favor of abolishing or privatizing the V.A. in some way. And that didn`t just happen overnight, even though it happened fast. Candidates this year were led in that direction, in part by this group. This is a group called Concerned Veterans for America, a fairly new conservative veterans group. They have been quietly courting the Republican presidential candidates over the past year, and singing to them the virtues of getting rid of the V.A. They`ve held a series of town hall events with this year`s presidential candidates in the early primary states and one by one, the Republican candidates have dutifully said that, yes, they see the light, they too want to radically change the way veterans in this country get their care, in some cases to turn veterans over to the private health insurance market even though veterans themselves say they very much do not want that. Concerned Veterans for America has been led for a long time by this guy, seen here in his other job as a FOX News Channel host. Naturally. His name is Pete Hegseth. He`s a veteran himself. And about a year and a half ago, Mr. Hegseth let out a little secret about Concerned Veterans for America. He kind of spilled the beans on a thing that had long been suspected but was never actually verified until he said it out-loud. Which is that this ostensibly grassroots veterans group, this group that has been single-mindedly focused on trying to kill the V.A., turns out they`re not so grassrootsy after all. In fact, the “kill the V.A.” conservative veterans group didn`t arise organically out of the veterans community. It was a deliberate creation of the billionaire conservative activist brothers Charles and David Koch. And the reason we know that the Koch brothers donor network supposedly created the grassroots veterans group is because the head of that group, Pete Hegseth himself, admitted it while speaking at a Koch donor conference about a year and a half ago. This is audio of those remarks. It was obtained by an online outfit called “The Undercurrent”, was published by “The Nation”, although MSNBC has not independently verified it. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, CONCERNED VETERANS FOR AMERICA: Concerned Veterans for America is an organization this network literally created. Now, unless you`ve been living under a rock for the last couple of months, you know about the crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs. What you probably don`t know is the central role that Concerned Veterans for America played in exposing and driving this crisis from the very beginning. I thank Charles and David, Marc Short, Kevin Gentry, everyone that puts in the sweat equity that makes this possible. And I want to thank you for your courage for standing up and being here. KEVIN GENTRY, VICE PRESIDENT, CHARLES KOCH FOUNDATION: Concerned Vets is something that came out of this network, and you all as investors are the ones who made this happen. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That is reportedly the Koch brothers guy at the end there saying, “You all as Koch network investors, you all are the ones who made this group happened, you created Concerned Veterans.” We reached out to the Koch donor network to see if they could tell us how much they have given this group and if they share this policy goal of killing the V.A. We haven`t yet heard back. But it`s kind of one of the sleeper issues of this campaign, that the Republican candidates have basically been captured by this Koch brothers- created, this Koch brothers-funded movement to kill the Veterans Administration. And now, in the midst of that effort with Iowa a week from Monday, with just a few months to go before the general election when presumably this issue is going to pop like you can`t believe it in the general election. I mean, imagine the fights about this at the general election debates. Right when all this kill the V.A. Koch brothers-funded organizing is about to blow up as an issue, the guy who has led that group, the guy who`s been at the forefront of this abolish the va movement since it started, he has just all of a sudden poofed. He`s just disappeared. He quit. He is no longer the head of Concerned Veterans for America, and nobody seems to know why. Hmm. Officially both sides are saying this was a mutual decision, we reached out to Concerned Veterans this week, they declined to provide any more details about what happened. Pete Hegseth told us himself he left over a, quote, “difference of opinion over the future of the organization.” And that`s basically all he would say. But regardless of the circumstances of his departure, what happens now? Because this is weird, right? This one group has been the driving force behind all of these Republican candidates getting on board with this incredibly radical idea of killing the V.A., making veterans fend for themselves in the private health insurance market to get their coverage, which brings a huge, totally hot button issue into the general election because, obviously, no Democratic candidate is going to stand for that and almost all of the Republicans want to do it. But now, the group that has turned this radical idea into mainstream Republican policy, they appear to be in the midst of maybe melting down themselves. This policy position on privatizing the V.A. or getting rid of it is now basically part of the Republican Party platform. It`s conservative orthodoxy now that the V.A. has to be burned to the ground and never rebuilt, good luck, vets. And if you disagree with that you have to be called out as a V.A. apologist. It was this Koch brothers-created group that helped push the Republican Party to that radical position. Now, their top guy has poofed right at the start of the election with no explanation whatsoever. So, what happens next here? And does that mean that the most radical plan to deal with veterans` issues in our country that we have seen in generations poofs with him? Watch this space.

First question: Tuesday, we reported on Tuesday that New Jersey Chris Christie vetoed a New Jersey bill that wasn`t just bipartisan, it was actually unanimously passed in both the House and the Senate. Of course, Chris Christie is not just governor, he wants to be president. This bill is about guns. So, he killed it. What popular thing would that bill have done.

Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been spending some of the mountains of money that was raised to try to elect him president. In addition to a glossy 47-page full color magazine all about Jeb Bush, his campaign this week also spent money FedExing out an expensive looking item to a bunch of early-state voterers. Which of the following is a real Jeb Bush campaign expenditure from this week? Was it A, a scientific calculator that displayed a message disparaging Ted Cruz? Was it B, a video player preloaded with a movie about Jeb Bush? Was it C, a free set of snow tires? Or D, an I`m with Jeb leather motorcycle jacket? LEE: Well, I believe it was item B, a player. ', 'MADDOW:', ' The video player. Steve, what`s the right answer? BENEN: Let`s check Wednesday`s segment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What Jeb Bush FedExed out to voters in New Hampshire is a video player which automatically starts showing his Jeb Bush movie as soon as you open it up.

LEE: Aye yai yai, what a choice. Let`s go non-Donald Trump. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. The answer to the Donald Trump question was Oklahoma. But the non Donald Trump question was this.

      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 20, 2016 Guest: Matt Katz, Nicolle Wallace ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Thanks, my friend. CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: You bet. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Last night, late in the hour on this show, I did a one-on-one interview live from Iowa with Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont. At the tail end of that interview, in response to a question from me about endorsements in the campaign, Senator Sanders characterized some of the best-known and most influential lefty advocacy groups in the country by using a term that upset a bunch of people in Democratic politics, including the groups he was talking about. And that has now opened up what appears to be kind of a big new front, a big new point of contention between Senator Sanders and his chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton. This has ended up being a big point of contention all day, both campaigns have been fielding questions about this and trying to press their advantage on this point all day long today, including direct comments on the subject from former President Bill Clinton today, which we will get to in just a moment. But because that statement from Senator Sanders, which has caused so much upset today, because it was made on this show and made late in the hour last night, I just want to play it for you now. I want to play it for you in context, without editing, so you can just hear exactly what it is that Senator Sanders said. You can understand exactly the way he meant it, to the extent that that`s possible by virtue of hearing it uncut and with the complete question. So – so you know. This is what happened. This is what he said and how he said it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Senator, let me ask you about another issue in terms of the way the campaign is going forward. Your policies on issues like gay rights and reproductive choice are very consistent. They should be very attractive to progressive groups. But there`s been a series of high-profile endorsements. Groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL, they`ve gone out of their way to make very early endorsements for Secretary Clinton. Just today, Human Rights Campaign, the gay rights group, announced their Clinton endorsement. Are you competing for those groups` endorsements and not getting them or are you not trying to get them? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look – well, no, Rachel. I would love to have the endorsement of every progressive organization in America. We`re very proud to have received recently the endorsement of MoveOn.org. We have received the endorsement of Democracy for America. These are grassroots organizations representing millions of workers. What we are doing in this campaign – it just blows my mind every day, because I see it clearly – we`re taking on not only Wall Street and the economic establishment, we`re taking on the political establishment. So I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund, in Planned Parenthood. But, you know what, Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment. I will challenge anybody with regard to my record on LGBT issues. You know, I was one of the few, relatively few to oppose and vote against DOMA, et cetera. In terms of women`s rights, I believe we have a 100 percent lifetime pro-choice record. But, you know, that`s what happens in politics. Look, I`m going to do well and hopefully win not because of establishment support. What we are going to do well at, and what we are doing well at is rallying the grassroots of this country. We have been going all over the country having just huge turnouts of people coming to our rallies. We have 2.5 million individual campaign contributions, more than any campaign in history. So, Rachel, I concede – you know, I`m not going to get establishment support. I`m not going to get the support of the governors and the senators, with few exceptions, many of the major organizations. But the reason that we are doing so well, why we`re ahead now, I believe in New Hampshire, while we`re closing the gap in Iowa, why we`re gaining – why we are gaining in Nevada and South Carolina, and why we`re doing better and better all over the country is not from the establishment. It is from the grassroots of America. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Not from the establishment. That in total is what Senator Bernie Sanders said last night. When I asked him about the fact that Planned Parenthood and the abortion rights group NARAL and the Human Rights Campaign had all endorsed, given organizational endorsements to Secretary Clinton instead of him. And that line of argument from Senator Sanders, that he would love to have the endorsement of every progressive organization in the country, but he didn`t expect to get the endorsement of groups like that, because those groups are, to quote him, “in fact, part of the establishment,” that has led to a sort of furious response, starting late last night and into today. In the first instance from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton herself, she tweeted last night, just after midnight, and this is one of those tweets that signed with her initial at the end, so it`s supposed to mean she wrote the tweet herself. The tweet says, quote, “Really, Senator Sanders? How can you say groups like Planned Parenthood and Human Rights Campaign are part of the establishment that you are taking on?” Then, the groups that the – that Senator Sanders was talking about in his answer last night on this show, they also responded first on Twitter. Planned Parenthood said, “We respect Senator Sanders, disappointed to be called establishment as we fight like hell to protect women`s health.” Then, Human Rights Campaign responded thereafter. They said, quote, “We share Planned Parenthood`s disappointment in Sanders` attacks. Human rights campaign has proudly taken on the establishment and fought for LGBT people for over 30 years.” That, of course, is funny, because if you`re trying to make the argument that you`re not establishment, never good idea to point out how many decades you`ve been around. But still, I take their point. Elise Hogue is the president of NARAL. She responded, similarly, but with her own spin o it. She wrote, quote, “Sadly, the establishment is the anti-choice forces out to end legal abortion and contraception. Not our friends, Planned Parenthood and Human Rights Campaign.” Planned Parenthood actually later followed that initial response up with a longer statement, elaborating on the source of their disappointment with what Senator Bernie Sanders said. The longer statement said, quote, “This country sees attacks against reproductive health, reproductive rights every day, especially from every single GOP candidate for president. It`s regrettable and surprising to hear Senator Sanders describe the very groups that fight on behalf of millions of often marginalized Americans, people who still have to fight for their most basic rights, as representing the establishment. Reproductive health care and rights and the full equality of LGBTQ people are core progressive values that should unite us all.” Honestly, support for abortion rights and gay rights is – these are not issues on which you are going to find substantive daylight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. They are both strong supporters of both of those progressive issues. And yes, you can differentiate between them in terms of who got there faster or who has been perfectly consistent or who is now more perfectly sensitive and attentive to these issues. But broadly speaking, especially when contrasted with the Republicans, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are on the same team when it comes to this stuff. If you are a voter who is very motivated by LGBTQ issues or if you are very motivated by reproductive choice issues, you are spoiled for choice in the Democratic primary. You`ve got allies on that side without question. Despite that basic truth, though, this is now, nevertheless, a real point of contention in the fight for the Democratic nomination. And it is in part because Secretary Clinton did get those organizational endorsements and Senator Sanders did not, that`s why I asked in the first place. But even more than that, it is because of the way he described his disappointment in not getting those endorsements and his characterization last night of those groups as basically part of the system – part of what he is up against, right? Part of what he is, in his words, taking on in the form of the establishment. And so, it`s one of the first really big fights on the Democratic side since this primary started. And maybe it was an unfortunate language choice, unfortunate framing by Senator Sanders to have effectively started fights now with these groups that he is a supporter of. I don`t know. We asked his campaign if Senator Sanders wanted to come back on tonight to elaborate on what he meant to respond to some of the criticism. Senator Sanders was not available tonight. We will try to get him back sometime soon if he does want to have that conversation. In the meantime, though, the competitive and increasingly exciting Democratic race for president today was in large part about this fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: We got people from Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign Fund who are campaigning for it. That`s another area of disagreement in the primary. Hillary does not consider Planned Parenthood a member of the establishment. And I don`t see how anybody else could. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former President Bill Clinton campaigning for his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, today in New Hampshire. And in the broad scope of those remarks, he made the sort of closing argument case that has evolved recently in the Clinton campaign, which is basically that she is a candidate who knows how to get stuff done. She is a practical progressive. But in the midst of making that argument, former President Clinton went out of his way there to get right at that point, to swipe directly at Senator Sanders for his remarks that Planned Parenthood and other progressive groups are part of the establishment, and that`s why they endorsed Hillary Clinton over him. So again, it`s been a source of controversy today. So far, the Sanders campaign is sticking with this line of argument, they`re not backing off at all. It will be interesting to see if that holds up. Particularly if the criticism from groups like Planned Parenthood stays so strong on this issue. It`s hard to imagine that Senator Sanders would want to be seen as having a beef with an organization like that heading into the start of voting in the Democratic presidential primary. And meanwhile, we just got in the latest spending numbers on the campaign. On the Democratic side of the campaign – again, uncharacteristically interesting news today. Today`s news on ad spending shows that all told, from the beginning of the campaign through now, Senator Sanders has now surpassed Hillary Clinton in terms of the amount of money that he has spent on ads. It`s close, but he`s ahead. Senator Sanders, of course, doesn`t have a super PAC like almost every other candidate in the race does, including Secretary Clinton. All of Bernie Sanders` money that he spent on ads has all been spent through his campaign directly. So far, NBC News calculates he spent $12.8 million on ads. That`s just over $1 million more than what has been spent on Hillary Clinton`s behalf, both by her campaign, which is the bulk of her money, but also by a pro Clinton super PAC. So again, Bernie Sanders at $12.8 million. Hillary Clinton comes in at about $11.6 million. So she`s $1.2 million behind him. And I think that is – that is surprising. Or at least it would have been surprising looking at this race from the very beginning. Here`s the thing, though. Even though that`s a lot of money being spent by those two candidates and even though it`s interesting that Bernie Sanders has now spent more than Hillary Clinton, those two are small fries when it comes to overall spending this year, because everybody is spending this year, including theirs, is absolutely dwarfed by Jeb Bush. To get up to what Jeb Bush has spent, so far, you have to combine the campaign spending and super PAC spending from Hillary Clinton, includes Bernie Sanders, plus Chris Christie, plus John Kasich, plus Ben Carson, plus Ted Cruz, plus Donald Trump before you get up to the stratosphere where Jeb Bush is alone. Look at Jeb Bush in context in terms of what he spent. The only person spending anywhere near what Jeb Bush has spent and he`s not really anywhere near it is Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush combined, if you take them as the sort of outliers here, combined, they have spent $91 million on ads so far. Contrast that with what Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have spent combined, which is about $8 million all together, I mean, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are considerably behind Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in the polls. But they are outspending Ted Cruz and Donald Trump by an 11-1 ratio, which is nuts. That is absolutely nuts. And the people are winning – spend $8 million collectively. That`s not even what Hillary Clinton has spent. Anyway, it`s yet further evidence that money just doesn`t work the way it used to in this year`s presidential campaigning. At least on the Republican side, it doesn`t. And at least it doesn`t work the way it used to when it comes to ads. To that point, though, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, the big spenders in the campaign, they appear to be testing what else they might be able to spend their many millions of dollars on to see if other things might work, even if ads don`t. This is amazing. Today, the Jeb Bush campaign started handing out these glossy 47-page books about Jeb Bush. They`re titled “Jeb`s Plan for America.” It`s like a full-on book, glossy magazine all about Jeb Bush. Meet Jeb. It`s like a big biography and his whole campaign plan. This is an expensive thing to make. That said, nothing compared to this, which the Jeb Bush campaign sent out at the beginning of this week. These apparently arrived in people`s mailboxes in New Hampshire by FedEx overnight mail, which itself is a great way to burn money on shipping. And what these FedEx overnight packages contained is a Jeb Bush video. And, you know, in campaigns past, it used to be a big deal – it used to be a big spending showoff expense for a campaign to send out a video to voters in the early states. But what that meant when people used to send out a video, they would send out DVDs. They`d actually mail out disks. What Jeb Bush has actually done is he`s mailed out not copies of videos that people can play on their home machines or computers. They haven`t mailed out DVDs or disks. They have actually mailed out the machine. What Jeb Bush just FedExed – overnight FedExed out to voters in New Hampshire this week is a video player, which automatically starts showing his Jeb Bush movie as soon as you open it up. It`s not the video, it`s the video player. Apparently, it`s too cold in New Hampshire right now to literally light money on fire, so they have decided to do it this way in instead. It`s almost like Jeb Bush doesn`t know what to do with his $100 plus million, which his super PAC raised for him back when he is supposed to be a competitive nominee. So, now, they have decided they don`t want to have any money left over in the coffers, when Jeb Bush has to drop out of the race sometime soon. And so, they`re just trying to spend all their money as fast as they can, and any way they can so there is none left to be awkward about. If that is what`s going on, the people of New Hampshire would probably be happier if Jeb Bush just mailed everybody in the state a new set of snow tires or a bottle of whiskey or just gave everybody 50 bucks. I mean, if you really have to get rid of the money, there`s nicer ways to do it. There`s ways that will make people happier than you shipping out video players by FedEx overnight package. The Marco Rubio campaign is also stepping up its ostentatious but still inexplicable spending. This week, the Rubio super PAC launched an ad which criticizes Ted Cruz for changing his positions for political benefit. The new nickname they have come up with him to support this ad campaign is “Calcula-Ted.” “Calcula-Ted”. And just in case that`s too hard to understand, the Rubio super PAC has also been giving out calculators in order to make the point that he is “Calcula-Ted”. I`d rather have – even one snow tire or like 15 bucks. I`d rather have a gift card to the toad stool gift store in Peterborough, New Hampshire. I love that place. But instead, you get scientific calculators. We are apparently at that time in the race when candidates who have more money than support have decided to really show off what their money can do. In addition to the Calcula-Ted ad, and its calculators to help you get the joke, the Rubio campaign has also started running another sort of ridiculous ad, showing Canadian Ted Cruz silhouetted in a maple leaf, trying to make the case that Ted Cruz is a socialist foreigner. And on that point, I just want – I have an unexpected observation to make. And I want to bring this to you tonight, because it ends on a shockingly pleasant and complimentary note. You wouldn`t expect that from these guys right now. But this is really, really sweet. If you have been feeling at all bad about today`s news and today`s politics, I thought it might be nice to give you something shockingly sweet and pleasant from an unexpected place. And that is where this next part of this is going. I swear. It`s really good. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' OK. This has a good ending, I swear. And it`s something you have never seen before, and it`s going to blow your mind. A really good ending. You won`t think I`m leading to a good ending, but I`m leading to a good ending. All right. The context here is just how nasty things are between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and the Republican presidential fight right now. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are fighting so aggressively right now and with such almost hysterical focus on each other, it`s almost like their junior high school kids who secretly have a crush on each other. I mean, there`s those ads from Marco Rubio about Ted Cruz being Calcula-Ted and the scientific calculators they`re handing out to make that point. And there`s the Ted Cruz secretly Canadian foreign socialist. All this stuff from Marco Rubio. Those ads which launched seem to be bothering Ted Cruz a little bit. And I think you can see that on the stump for Senator Cruz. Look at how Senator Cruz, for example, goes out of his way to swipe at Marco Rubio in the middle of what is otherwise his kind of normal stump speech, in this case being delivered in New Hampshire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let`s take the issue of amnesty. Everyone today says they`re against amnesty. Well, except for Marco. But the rest of them all say they`re against amnesty. In 2013, Barack Obama and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer, joined by a whole bunch of establishment Republicans, including Marco Rubio, pushed a massive amnesty plan. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Did I mention that Marco Rubio was – you know, establishment Republicans like saying Marco Rubio. Do you know Marco Rubio is an establishment – these guys cannot leave each other alone right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CRUZ: I appreciate your dumping your oppo research folder on the debate stage. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, it`s your record. CRUZ: But I will say – DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Do you think they like each other? CRUZ: – at least half of the things Marco said are flat out false. They`re absolutely false. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So that – just that – just to set the context here about how nasty things are between mark owe ruin owe and Ted Cruz right now. These two 44-year-old first-year senators just killing each other right now. And whatever the competitive dynamics are between the two of them, there is a mean-spiritedness in terms of their tone about each other right now on the campaign trail. That`s what`s going on in their part of the political world right now. But I promised you this ended somewhere nice. And here is the nice part, brought to us by the national treasure that is the C-Span archives. Use this however you like. Do with this what you will. But this is real. We did not make it up. It is not sarcastic. It is not out of context. This is from 2013. Just let this wash over you and make you happy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUBIO: All we want is for you guys to give us a chance. Isn`t that what this issue is all about, Senator? CRUZ: The junior senator from Florida is absolutely correct. I agree entirely. And let me say, Senator Rubio, you inspire me. Senator Marco Rubio is a critical national leader. When Senator Mike Lee began this fight, Marco Rubio was there on day one from the beginning. Despite the how else of protest, despite official Washington, saying that he should know better than to stand up against the D.C. establishment and stand for the people. And let me tell you, I don`t know that there is any more effective, more articulate, more persuasive voice for conservative principles than my friend Marco Rubio. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I don`t know if Ted Cruz is going to win Iowa or not. But whether he does or doesn`t, someday, Ted Cruz is going to be the star of a really, really excellent campaign ad for Marco Rubio. Oh, treachery, oh politics. We`ve got lots more ahead tonight. Stay with us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CRUZ: Senator Rubio, you inspire me. Senator Marco Rubio is a critical national leader. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So there`s some serious news to report tonight on the terrible accident involving two U.S. marine helicopters which apparently collided in midair off the coast of Hawaii. And this is not just a run-of-the-mill U.S. military training accident. This involves a lot of people. It was 12 U.S. marines on board. Those two Sea Stallion helicopters. They apparently collided while doing a nighttime training mission last Thursday. Now, the Coast Guard has been leading a search and rescue operation since then, along with help from local authorities, the navy sent two destroyers to help search for survivors of that crash. Earlier this week, officials announced they had found some debris and four life rafts from the choppers. But there was nobody aboard those rafts and they didn`t find any personal items left behind that would indicate if somebody had been aboard one of the rafts at one time. The sad news tonight after five straight days of searching, including in some very high seas, 30 and 40-foot seas, the Coast Guard now has officially suspended its search for those 12 missing marines. The Marine Corps is leading a recovery and salvage effort, but the search for survivors is suspended. In the absence of finding any of those marines are alive or even finding their bodies, a memorial for the 12 lost marines is planned for Friday at the Marine Corps base in Hawaii. But again, the search for them right now suspended. We`ll keep you posted as we learn more. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' In a nutshell, this is how Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey wants you to think of him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me tell you something: after you graduate from Wall Street, you conduct yourself like that in a courtroom, your rear end is going to get thrown in jail, idiot. I sat here, stood here and very respectively listened to you. If you what want to do is put on a show and giggle every time I talk, well then I have no interest in answering your question. Good, good. I`m glad you do. Either sit down and keep quiet or get out. One or the other. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It was town hall events like those and the tape of those town halls which was highly promoted by the governor`s office, which helped make Chris Christie nationally famous. The governor`s office still promotes these things online, on their YouTube page. But in these clips, he seems so real, right? So off-the-cuff, so unrehearsed, especially when he encounters the naysayers of his state. Well, now we know, thanks in part to reporter Matt Katz of WNYC, just how rehearsed those video moments actually were. And what it cost the taxpayers of New Jersey to produce them, literally to produce them, like producing a TV show. For Matt Katz`s very timely new book, Chris Christie doubled his communication staff, reaching a taxpayer-funded payroll of $1.4 million a year. He hired an extensive team to staff town halls, including videographers and a guy with stage management – with a stage management degree to set up professional lighting that made him look approachable, but in charge. That was in 2010. And within months of launching his taxpayer-funded professionally staged and lit traveling floor show, the governor was already reaping the rewards for his very expensive on-camera performances. He was being touted as a huge threat for the 2012 presidential nomination. Governor Christie basked in that attention all year long in 2011 before finally saying, no, that he wouldn`t run in mid-October of that year. Now, though, Governor Christie has decided that it is his time. He`s also having trouble recapturing the old glitz that made him seem like such a catch four years ago. Governor Christie has been mired at the bottom of national polls. The latest national poll out today has him at 3 percent, tied with Mike Huckabee. And his popularity in his home state of New Jersey is at an all-time low. And now less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, now there is this new book out by a reporter who has basically shadowed Governor Christie for five years. And the book includes lots of new details on a lot of things about Chris Christie, but those include the scandals that emerged mostly in Governor Christie`s second term in office, which turned him from a presidential shoe-in to basically a presidential asterisk. Here`s the scenario, right? An Iowa or New Hampshire Republican is considering Chris Christie. They see this new book, just out, about Governor Christie. It`s called “American Governor,” it has this flattering photo of him on the cover. They pick it up at the airport or at their local bookstore because they want to learn a little something about this guy who is asking for their vote. In so doing, they may, for example, stumble upon Matt Katz`s fairly lured reporting about how Governor Christie`s office used steel remains from the Twin Towers as well as flags from a 9/11 memorial basically as political gifts to grease the political skids for himself and open doors. Quote, “Through the governor`s political appointees, the Christie administration collected shards of steel that had burned when the World Trade Center Twin Towers exploded into fire. They gathered American flags that had flown over Ground Zero during a ceremony for the 10th anniversary of the attacks. The steel and flags were then distributed to New Jersey mayors.” Quote, “This was no casual operation. More than 50 World Trade Center flags from distributed, all came with letters from the governor. One source at the Port Authority acknowledged to me, quote, `They leveraged 9/11 to the max.`” Matt Katz`s new book also breaks new ground on the very famous bridge scandal. The bridge scandal that led to multiple criminal indictments of the governor`s staffers and appointees, the scandal the governor initially dismissed to Matt Katz as all one big stupid joke. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIE: I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody, I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. So, I wasn`t – but I actually was the guy working the cones out there. You really are not serious with that question. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Joining us now is that Matt Governor Christie was addressing in 2013. Matt Katz, reporter of WNYC and New Jersey Public Radio, and author of the new book, “American Governor: Chris Christie`s Bridge to Redemption.” Matt, it`s great to have you here. Congratulations on the new book. MATT KATZ, AUTHOR, “AMERICAN GOVERNOR”: Thank you, Rachel. Appreciate it. ', 'MADDOW:', ' We have talked a lot about Chris Christie in the last couple years. You have meticulously crafted a 130-page-long time line of bridgegate in this. I know you`ve gone through hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of documents, lots of interviews flushing out this timeline. Specifically on the bridge issue, did you get any closer to knowing what Governor Christie knew while the bridge thing was unfolding? KATZ: Closest I was able to figure out, and this is based on a picture that was actually taken by a photographer for the Port Authority, the agency he oversaw, was that he had a conversation with David Wildstein, who is the guy from the Port Authority who has since pleaded guilty to being involved in the scheme, to actually running this scheme. He – he and the governor actually had a conversation while the lanes were closed, while people were stuck in traffic on day three of the lane closures at a 9/11 – September 11th ceremony at Ground Zero. And we see them laughing and chatting together, and spending time together at the ground zero ceremony, while Wildstein is checking his BlackBerry. I have no other evidence that the governor knew during or before the lanes were closed. The second piece I was able to put together, and lay it out in there is the number of – the amount of noise that was going on within the administration that something shady had happened at the bridge. And people knew about this. There were people floating names to the governor. A few weeks – a couple months after the lanes were closed, before anybody knew that anybody in his administration had their fingerprints on it, he was being told that he should look at certain people. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Look at certain people as potentially culpable for what had happened. KATZ: People who had evidence, e-mails indicating information about how this scheme came about. And he had several federal prosecutors working for him. He`s a former U.S. attorney, federal prosecutor himself. And there were some interviews conducted. People that he did direct his staff to, you know – check up on this. But they were – they were pretty shallow. And they didn`t go very far, and there were leads that were not followed up on. And if it wasn`t for a dogged reporting by reporters in New Jersey, and a subpoena from the Democrats in the legislature, we would have never gotten this e-mail tied for some traffic problems in Ft. Lee and that`s how we know about the scandal. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Matt, in a couple weeks, one of the things we have been keeping an eye on in terms of Governor Christie`s career and also in terms of the scandal, there is going to be a court hearing scheduled over whether a list of unindicted co-conspirators in the bridge case, people who prosecutors say helped organize the lane closures, will be made public. Do you have any sense of the odds that Governor Christie might be on that list? KATZ: I don`t know the odds. It is plausible that the governor or other people close to him are on the list. Anybody who was in the administration at the time could be on the list. We have no evidence from the governor that we have ever seen – we have lots of e-mails from other people. The governor has only released one e-mail ever about anything from his time as governor. And that was a resignation statement when – while this guy, Wildstein, who has since pleaded guilty, when he resigned as things were heating up over there, the governor made his resignation statement a little laudatory. And we got that only through a subpoena. But other than that, we have never seen any of his correspondence with any of his top aides while this was going on. There were text messages that we knew he sent to a chief of staff, an incoming chief of staff as a legislative hearing into this affair was going on. But that text exchange was deleted, and he says his phone – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Never recovered. KATZ: Exactly. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And there`s been one e-mail in total released from this thing. KATZ: Yes, or from anything involving this governor, yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Matt Katz, reporter for WNYC and New Jersey Public Radio, author of the new book, “American Governor: Chris Christie`s Bridge to Redemption” – congratulations on the book and on excellent, excellent timing. Well done. KATZ: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sit like this right here.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I say it sends a pretty strong message to the propaganda media that tries to make it out that Donald Trump is alienating himself from the women voters. I think Sarah Palin coming out and speaking send a strong message that the country is becoming unified behind a candidate, and the women are standing behind that candidate as well. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People that don`t like Palin, that it might hurt Trump`s chances, is that what you`re saying? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe, possibly. Personally, I like her. So it`s not going to – it doesn`t matter to me. But there are some people that don`t like her. I mean, she doesn`t work for FOX News any more. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former Republican vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, has endorsed Donald Trump for president. Voters` opinion on that is one thing. The man who picked her to be his vice presidential nominee back in 2008, that`s quite another thing. And that story is ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Tesla, best known for being an American auto company. They design and manufacture really high-end, fast electric cars. I`ve never driven one, but I would love to, thank you very much. The company is named after legendary pioneering electrical engineer and physicist and inventor, Nikola Tesla. Tesla also happens to be the name of these guys, California band formed in the `80s. They apparently found Nikola Tesla so inspiring that they ditched their original band name, which was City Kidd. Kidd with two Ds and pitched that and decided to go with Tesla instead. Neither Tesla the car company nor Tesla the band formerly known as City Kidd should be confused with Tulsa, the Oklahoma city where Donald Trump held a campaign rally today. At first, we all thought that Mr. Trump was going to Tulsa, the second-largest city in Oklahoma, but then we saw the media credentials handed out for today`s event and there you have it. This press pass is good for access at today`s “Make America Great Again” rally in Tusla, Oklahoma. Today`s rally in Tusla was the second day that former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, just one day after endorsing him in Iowa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH PALIN (R), FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: Now, it`s funny to be here in Oklahoma. Here the land of red dirt with your red bud trees. And here we have got a red head from the big red apple running for president. And yet the GOP machine all of a sudden, they`re saying we`re not red enough. We`re not conservative enough. And I say, what in the world do they know about conservatism? (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Referring to Donald Trump as a red head. Kind of like calling Tulsa Tesla, right, just a shade off. More broadly though, Sarah Palin is critiquing the Republican establishment and her decision to endorse Donald Trump has hit one particular part of that Republican establishment in a way that`s different than everybody else. And that`s the person of Senator John McCain, the man who chose Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential running mate in 2008. And in the years, since he has never wavered in his loyalty to Governor Palin, regardless of how badly that `08 race ultimately turned out and her role in it turning out badly and regardless of whatever Sarah Palin has or done since then, John McCain has stood by her over and over again, even insisting recently that picking her was the best decision he ever made, even after all she turned out to be. Despite that unswerving loyalty, Sarah Palin has endorsed Donald Trump, who has famously refused to apologize for saying that senator McCain was, quote, “not a war hero,” and that he, Donald Trump, prefers people who weren`t captured. Even now, even as Sarah Palin aligns herself with the man who said that about Senator McCain`s military service about his years as a tortured prisoner of war in Vietnam, John McCain will still not say a bad word about Sarah Palin. When asked about the endorsement today, McCain told reporters, quote, “I have great affection and appreciation for her. I respect what she does,” quote, “I respect her view.” Amazing. Joining us now is my friend Nicolle Wallace, former McCain-Palin campaign senior strategist, somebody who I think it`s fair to say still has a little stress left over from that time years ago. Fair enough? NICOLLE WALLACE, FOREMR MCCAIN-PALIN CAMPAIGN SENIOR STRATEGIST: Rosie O`Donnell on “The View” diagnosed it as PTSD and it just might be. I have to say, though, as I said on “MORNING JOE” this morning, we were talking about Flint and I know it`s not what we`re here tonight. But I said everything I know from watching that story, and the whole world is covering Flint, you deserve a lot of credit – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oh, thank you for saying that. WALLACE: – for months and weeks. I know I`ve e-mailed you to find out about the charities. Now, everybody knows how to help. And I think the fact that all the policymakers are there this week, you should feel some satisfaction that at least everyone is at the beginning for helping these people. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Thank you for saying that. We`ve got an update on Flint, because the governor`s e-mail came out and stuff. So thanks. WALLACE: On to more important things. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You are the person I want to know. You obviously have a different perspective on Governor Palin than others. But this particular point, I don`t need to – I don`t necessarily need to know your pundit opinion ever whether this is going to help or hurt Donald Trump. WALLACE: Because pundits have never been more relevant than 2016. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oh, definitely. The crystal ball has never been clearer. But what about this loyalty issue? WALLACE: Yes, listen, you make a great point and I believe above all else, that politics is the giant X-ray machine that reveals everyone`s character, his and hers. And, listen, that`s out there. But Donald Trump isn`t making a character play in Iowa, right? Donald Trump has done three really interesting things that to me I have to say impress me. He has abandoned control of his campaign message for the first time in a year for 30 minutes last night, he was totally out of control of his campaign message – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Just standing there and taking it on the stage – WALLACE: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' – while she talked and he was motionless. WALLACE: And he has never ceded has campaign control of his campaign message to anyone. He gave it up to her because he and Ted Cruz, I described them as two tarantulas in a bowl. Only one is coming out alive in Iowa. And it is shrewd on his part to cede control to Sarah Palin, to try to gain advantage over this rather small pool of evangelicals. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Because Ted Cruz is never going to attack Sarah Palin in the same way because it`s a distraction. WALLACE: He can`t, he can`t. And Trump is playing this sort of three-dimensional chess game and there`s a sheer political call shrewdness about it that is impressive. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let me ask – we`ve got interesting evidence that some of the establishment, particularly some of the donor class in the Republican Party, is coming around to the idea of Donald Trump. (CROSSTALK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`re getting close to acceptance. Yes. And I wonder if this might interrupt that in some ways. Just because Sarah Palin is a reminder of what happens when candidates get thrown into very high stakes elections, but also because of the John McCain issue on this, particularly given the dignity and unswerving loyalty in which he`s treated her. WALLACE: Yes. You know, John McCain`s former campaign manager Rick Davis did an interview tonight that I think sort of sent a signal that John McCain is sort of unbothered by this, that Sarah Palin, though he`s had permission to be Sarah Palin, this is sort of another step in this. You know, his guy, Lindsey Graham is out. John McCain`s single most important issue is foreign policy. So I`m guessing that until and unless someone impressed him on that front, he won`t endorse anyone else now that Lindsey is out. But he has never sort of given up his affection and whatever debt of gratitude he feels for the excitement she brought to his campaign. Rick reminded me tonight that the day before she was there, crowds, you know, were 10,000. The day after they were announced, there was 60,000 people in the arena. So, John McCain still seems to feel loyal for her for that excitement that she brought to his campaign. ', 'MADDOW:', ' He is modeling personal loyalty in a way that is out of this time. WALLACE: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Nicolle Wallace, former McCain/Palin campaign senior strategist and all around good egg. Thank you for being here. WALLACE: Thanks for having me. ', 'MADDOW:', ' We got much more ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Today, Barack Obama himself weighed in on the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. And the governor of Michigan released two years of his own emails relating to Flint and to that crisis, and that news that he was going to release those e-mails, it seems like it might be really illuminating, might be a big new day in terms of us understanding what happened in this crisis. That was until we saw the first e-mail in that release. Ahh, the things that we`ve learned. Hold that thought. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, I am very proud of what I`ve done as president. But – (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) The only job that`s more important to me is the job of father. And I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids` health could be at risk. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' President Obama speaking in Detroit about lead-poisoned Flint, Michigan, where he`s pledging federal help. Also today, as promised, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan released his own e-mails about Flint from the past two years. His office says the 274 pages they released today are all the e-mails the governor sent or received about Flint this year and last year. It begins with an e-mail in which every single line is redacted. That was an auspicious start. But there`s lots to see in the rest of the document, especially by the time outside researches have proved that Flint really did have a problem with lead in its water and the Snyder administration was trying to figure why everybody was blaming them. This is to Rick Snyder from his chief of staff in late September. The subject line is Flint water. It says, quote, “I can`t figure out why the state is responsible.” I can help you with that. It`s because the state was in charge of Flint and everything that happened in to it. The whole time this crisis was brewing, Flint was under control of state- appointed city managers, one after another. They didn`t report to voters. They reported to Governor Rick Snyder, which brings us to one more big answered question. Governor Snyder today released his e-mails from 2014 and 2015. You can tell how much pressure he`s under just by his decision to reveal anything from his inbox. But he hasn`t revealed everything. The governor`s own time line of the crisis shows key decisions in this, including decisions to switch Flint`s water source, the decision were made in 2013. The switch was enacted in 2014, but Flint`s emergency manager made the decision to do it in 2013. We asked Governor Snyder`s office last night whether he would, therefore, release his e-mails on Flint from 2013. His office replied to us, “The governor`s e-mails will be available Wednesday at michigan.gov/snyder. This is an unprecedented move.” Well, yes, but we would like to see the e-mails from the other year of the crisis. If what the governor wants is full transparency, then he is 2/3 of the way there. The final third when the decisions were actually made to do this, I think that would probably be the doozy here. That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.  ']\n",

Jane Mayer, a phenomenal reporter, “Dark Money”, thank you for being here. JANE MAYER, “DARK MONEY” AUTHOR: Glad to be with you. HAYES: All right. That is “ALL IN” for this evening. THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW starts right now. Good evening, Rachel. ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Thanks, my friend. And thanks to you at home for joining this hour. This year, this summer, summer of 2016, the Republicans are going to have their presidential nominating convention in the middle of July. And then the Democrats are going to go after that. The conventions are unusually early this year which means the parties will pick their nominees sooner than they usually do. That means in effect that the general election will last longer than it usually does. But in terms of nominating a presidential candidate, technically peeking the Republicans are going to go first this year. And every cycle it`s done a little differently. In 2008, not only were the conventions much later that year, they didn`t happen till it August and September, but the order was reversed from this year in 2008, the Democrats went first. Democrats held their big nominating convention for Barack Obama and Joe Biden in Denver. You might remember it culminated with that big speech in that huge arena in Denver where Barack Obama spoke on that set with the big theatrical columns. It was very dramatic. The Republicans that year in 2008, they made a bold decision that they would take advantage of the fact that the Democrats were going first and they would take advantage of the fact that the conventions were so late that year. So the momentum coming out of the conventions was going to be really important for the general election. Because of those two factors, they decided to do something very bold. They decided in 2008 that one day after the Democratic convention was over, the very next day, John McCain would name his vice presidential running mate. They didn`t name the person who was going to run with McCain until after the Democrats had their convention. It`s kinds of a genius move, right? It meant the biggest move who John McCain was going to pick as his running mate was this is distracting parlor game that everybody was nattering about all through the Democratic Convention when they should have been talking about Barack Obama and Joe Biden. It also meant when John McCain made his announcement, it by necessity would completely take over the political news cycle, so it would squash all of the Democrats` momentum from their convention. The day after that convention was over, it was over. It turned the whole narrative of the race on its head. In that tiny little window between the Democratic Convention and the Republican Convention in `08, the John McCain campaign basically just decided that they were going to defibrillate the election that year. And boom, they did. One day after the Denver of convention was over in Fairborn, Ohio, John McCain basically yelled “clear” and then shocked everybody by picking Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate. And the American people`s initial reaction was, I`m sorry, who now? Gallup released this polling data the day after Sarah Palin was announce. Look at the headline, quote, “Palin unknown to most Americans.” But she quickly became very, very, very famous. And she initially became very popular. She gave that rollicking well-received speech at the Republican Convention, that was the lipstick on a pig speech. Remember? She was in huge demand at Republican campaign events. She was all over magazine covers at the time. There was this huge clamor and tons of interest in her. Everything was going great and then she started doing interviews. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Do you agree with the Bush doctrine? SARAH PALIN (R), THEN-VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In what respect, Charlie? INTERVIEWER: The Bush – what do you interpret it to be? PALIN: His world view? INTERVIEWER: No, the Bush doctrine enunciated in September, 2002, before the Iraq war. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That was Governor Palin`s first interview as a vice presidential candidate. Didn`t go well. She would do OK when she was interviewed in friendly territory like right wing talk radio or the FOX News Channel, but anytime they would let her out of that bubble, it went badly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: I was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand – PALIN: I`ve read most of them again with a great appreciation for the press, for the media. INTERVIEWER: Like what ones specifically I`m curious. PALIN: All of them, any of them that have been in front of me over all these years. INTERVIEWER: Can you name a few? PALIN: I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news. Alaska isn`t a foreign country. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' The Sarah Palin choice both its timing and the fact that it was her, it was really an audacious strategic move by the McCain campaign to try to change the trajectory of the 2008 presidential race and the initial launch was very successful. She didn`t withstand the scrutiny very well though and the close questioning. And in the end, between that Republican convention speech that was so successful and ultimately Election Day, the overall trajectory of her impact on the McCain campaign was downward. By October 30th, by just a couple of days before the election, whatever help she might have been early on had very clearly evaporated. She had become a hindrance, not a help. A “New York Times”/CBS poll found 59 percent of the country didn`t think Sarah Palin was prepare for the job that John McCain had picked her for. That number was going up and up and up the longer the campaign went on. Quote, “Nearly a third of voters polled say the vice presidential selection would be a major factor influencing their votes and those voters broadly favor Senator Barack Obama.” A couple of days later, of course, Senator Barack Obama and Joe Biden went on to win that presidential election and they won by a lot. But then in the political life of Governor Palin, thereafter, things just continued to go weirdly. Within a matter of months after that election, Governor Palin had decided to inexplicably and without warning quit her job as governor of Alaska. She was still in the middle of her first term as governor but she quit because she said she had other political desires that she could not quite explain but she insisted those other political things she wanted to do insisted she would have to leave her job as governor. She then got news jobs on the Fox News Channel for a while and on various reality shows. Eventually she starred what was basically an Internet channel called Sarah Palin TV, Sarah Palin Channel. That`s over now too, I think. Although how would we know? In 2011, she briefly flirted with running for president herself. You might remember at one point in the summer of 2011, her exploration of a possible Sarah Palin presidential run produced a Palin family bus tour. Remember that? In which she and an entourage of relatives and assistants, staffers set off across the country. They said they just wanted to be tourists and sight see memorably in New York City, the Sarah Palin is maybe running for president bus tour also involved Governor Palin eating pizza in Midtown Manhattan with Donald Trump and his wife that is where Donald Trump famously ate pizza with a knife and fork. Ultimately though, Governor Palin decided she would not run for president in 2012. Although again, her quitting announcement, her announcement why she was not going to run for president like the time she quit running for governor, it was a just little hard to understand. Just in terms of her choice of language and how she was trying to explain herself, it was just hard to get. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PALIN: You know, there was that is sense through my own personal internal deliberations in making this decision, I would go back and forth about whether now is the time and if I say no to the opportunity that`s in front of me via running for office now will politically speaking will I die, will I be ineffective? But no, after making the decision today and making the announcement, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt after great confirmation today too, Greta, personally speaking. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I don`t know. I mean, I can tell because of the questions that Greta asked her that night because of what it said in terms of the words at the bottom of the screen. I could tell them what was going on there was she was announcing she was not running for president in 2012 but just listening to her it was very hard to get. That tends to be a theme with Governor Palin. But she has not had a job in politics since she quit as Alaska`s governor in 2009. She is mostly a conservative media celebrity now. She`s not a particularly prolific one though. The only major appearance she has made in the last six months was at that the Washington, D.C. rally against the Iran deal last September. That was the rally where the crowd seemed very happy she was there. It seemed almost news worthy she had flown all way from Alaska to Washington to be there. But again, once she started talking, it was hard to follow exactly what she meant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PALIN: Remember, the enemy comes to kill still and destroy. But now they`re going to inspect themselves? Oh, what could go wrong with that? Yes, don`t call us. We`ll call you, they say. And that`s really good because Obama is standing by with his mighty phone and his mighty pen in case they stretch the truth a little. And they start dropping bombs. No, only in an Orwellian Obama world full of sprinkly fairy dust broken from atop his unicorn as he`s peeking through a really pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty. This treaty will not bring peace. You don`t reward terrorism. You kill it! (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It is sometimes hard to know what Sarah Palin means, just on a day to day basis. Sometimes it is hard to follow what she is talking about. But it is also hard to know what she means in Republican politics anymore. And that is newly relevant because today, she is backing in be to Republican presidential politics in a big way with a big high profile endorsement decision. That is, I think, probably going to cause a lot of upset in one particular part of the Republican establishment. And it`s not about Sarah Palin`s popularity with the conservative base. It`s not about how much pull she`s got with her, I don`t know, Facebook followers or wherever people follow her now. It is about something personal and specific, because when the John McCain campaign in 2008 decided to elevate Sarah Palin from total obscurity to make her his vice presidential running mate, they knew they were making a big strategic gamble, right? They knew they were taking a big risk and it turned out in the end to be a bad choice. It hurt John McCain`s chances, right? I mean, who knows if John McCain could have won that presidential campaign in any circumstances when George W. Bush the outgoing Republican president had a 22 percent approval rating, right? But picking Sarah Palin we now know did not help. It hurt his chances in the end. And John McCain has there ever been asked about that bad decision he made concerning Sarah Palin. He`s been asked about it over and over and over and over again. And John McCain from the very beginning has been unflinchingly loyal to her. He has never thrown her under the bus. He has never conceded it was a bad decision to pick her. He has never ever said a bad word against her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I have the greatest appreciation for Governor Palin and her family. There`s great joy to know them. She invigorated our campaign. I have no doubt of my admiration and respect for her. I have great respect and admiration for her and her family. INTERVIEWER: That was your choice, you`re proud of it. MCCAIN: I`m very proud. INTERVIEWER: Think she could be president one day? MCCAIN: Sure, sure. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' After John McCain and Sarah Palin lost that election in 2008, a friendly interviewer`s, confrontational interviewers everybody interviewing John McCain would basically ask him about that decision more or less trying to goad him into saying that yes, Sarah Palin that choice was a bad mistake. He would never ever concede that. He would never say it. Even later in 2009, when Governor Palin inexplicably quit as governor of Alaska, and I mean, literally inexplicable, nobody understood her explanation for why she was doing it, he still would not criticize her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: I respect Sarah Palin. I appreciate her and her husband enormously. I think she will continue to play a major role in the future of the Republican Party. And I have to respect the decision she made. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Even after she quit in the middle of her first term as Alaska governor. That was John McCain refusing to criticize her for that. The following year, in 2010, he had her to come to Arizona to campaign for him in his Senate re-election bid that year. By 2012, when the Republican Party was once again confronting this choice of who their nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney would pick as his running mate, at that point when Romney was considering who he would with, a lot of people came out of the woodwork in that discussion to talk about once again how terrible John McCain`s choice had been. How devastating it had been for his campaign. What a terrible choice she was. Even then, he refused to criticize her. He never would. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INTERVIEWER: Senator McCain, I want you to hear a sound bite from one of the Sunday shows. Dick Cheney sits down, talks about your selection of vice president candidate, Governor Palin. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: I like Governor Palin. I`ve met her. I know her. She`s an attractive candidate, but based on her background, she only was governor for what, two years. I don`t think she passed that test. INTERVIEWER: Being ready? CHENEY: Being ready to take over. I think that was a mistake. (END VIDEO CLIP) INTERVIEWER: Do you agree, disagree? MCCAIN: Well, I`m always glad to get comments four years later. Look, I respect the vice president. But the fact is that I`m proud of Sarah Palin. I`m proud of the job she did. I`m proud of the job she continues to do. I love Sarah. I think she is still the best decision that I have ever made. (END VIDEOTAPE) ', 'MADDOW:', ' The best decision I have ever made. That actually that last comment from the radio show was John McCain on the day of the New Hampshire primary in 2012. He has steadfastly stood by her. He has refused to ever criticize her, to ever admit there was anything wrong about her choice. He has been capital “L” loyal to her in such an unwavering way, even has his entire party has turned against this is decision that he made for obvious reasons. He has been unflinchingly loyal to her. And today as a thank you for that in response to everything John McCain has done for her and the way he today by her for all of these difficult years, today in thanks, Sarah Palin issued her endorsement for the 2016 presidential race. She endorsed this guy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I supported him for president. I raised a million dollars for him. Still a lot of money. I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But, you know, he lost. So I never liked him as much after that because I don`t like losers but, Frank, let me get to it. He hit me – he`s not a war hero. FRANK LUNTZ: He`s a war hero. Five and a half years – TRUMP: He`s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren`t captured, OK? (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' He`s not a war hero. John McCain`s running mate from 2008 today endorsed Donald Trump. What does this do to the race? What does this do to the Republican Party? We`ve actually got somebody on deck next who may know better than anybody what impact this is actually going to have. Stay with us. That`s next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' We still have a lot of political news to get to tonight including a live one-on-one interview with Bernie Sanders. That I`m very much looking forward to, that`s still ahead. But the political world came to a halt tonight with some very sad news out of Iowa. We had heard earlier in the day this had been a serious car crash involving campaign workers for Dr. Ben Carson. Now, we have the very sad news tonight that a Ben Carson campaign volunteer who was seriously injured in that crash earlier today, he has now died. There were four Carson staffers and volunteers who were involved in this crash. Three of them were treated and released at a hospital after their van went off the road in icy conditions and flipped over and was hit by another car. But one of those campaign staffers was taken to the nearest trauma center because his injuries are much more serious. The nearest trauma center was just over the Iowa border in Nebraska, at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. He was 25-year-old Carson campaign volunteer Braden Joplin. And again, we got word tonight that he has died because of his injuries in this crash. Very, very sad news, especially a 25-year-old kid, you know? It`s a reminder for all of the rollicking pitch and catch and crazy competition and crazy personals of the presidential campaign, it`s real human beings who are involved. It`s just very sad news. The Carson campaign suspended work today when they heard about the accident. Dr. Carson says he plans to meet with Braden Joplin`s family once he arrives in Omaha later this evening. Before we got news that Mr. Joplin passed away, the Carson`s campaign plan had been to suspend their campaign today and tomorrow but restart on Thursday. Now that the circumstances have changed and Mr. Joplin has died, we don`t know if that`s still the plan that the Carson campaign will basically unsuspend the day after tomorrow. But we`ll let you know as we learn more. Again, just very sad news tonight for the Ben Carson campaign and for everybody involved in politics. Tonight, though, we`ve got more ahead with Robert Costa. We`ve also got that live one on one interview with Bernie Sanders coming up later this hour. Please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PALIN: Look what`s happening today. Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they`re attacking their own front-runner. Now, would the left ever, would the DNC ever come after their front-runner and her supporters? No, because they don`t eat their own. They don`t self-destruct. But for the GOP establishment to be coming after Donald Trump`s supporters even with accusations that are so false, they are so busted the way that this thing works. We, you, a diverse dynamic needed support base that they would attack, and now some of them even whispering they`re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can`t afford to see the status quo go. Otherwise, they won`t be able to be slurping off the gravy train that`s been feeding them all these years. They don`t want that to end. Well, and then funny, ha, ha, not funny. But now what they`re doing is wailing, well, Trump and his Trumpeteers, well, they`re not conservative enough. Oh, my goodness gracious. What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism? And now though – (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin speaking earlier tonight in Iowa endorsing Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. Mr. Trump famously refused to apologize early in his campaign for insisting publicly that Governor`s Palin running mate from 2008, Senator John McCain was in Donald Trump`s words, quote, “not a war hero”. Now, Governor Palin has endorsed Mr. Trump. What impact is this going to have on the race and on the Republican Party? What effect is this going to have on John McCain? Joining us now is Robert Costa from “The Washington Post”, a story about Sarah Palin will be on “The Post`s” front page on A1 as of tomorrow. Robert, it`s nice to see you. Thanks for being here. ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST: Great to join you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' First, let me just ask the baseline calculation, is the Sarah Palin endorsement expected to be politically important in Iowa or more broadly? COSTA: Yes. What we`re watching, Rachel, is a paradigm shift in real-time because this is a party dominated by the outsiders. The anti-establishment voices, they are now the establishment. So, following the traditional rules an endorsement like this can wouldn`t rock the boat and wouldn`t have that much impact. But in a race 13 days before Iowa, where the two leading candidates have not been endorsed by a senator or a governor, a voice like Palin thus matters. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In terms of the – what I`m starting to think of as the mythical beast of the Republican establishment, which is the sort of inchoate idea that we keep talking about what they`re going to do and it never seems to have much impact or be manifest in very visible ways, obviously, it is one thing for Donald Trump to have taken a shot like he did early in his campaign at John McCain, calling him not a war hero. John McCain famously has been incredibly loyal to Sarah Palin ever since he picked her as his running mate. Does that hurt sort of dissing John McCain this way, by signing up with Donald Trump, does that cleave the Republican Party at all? What sort of impact is that going to have? COSTA: They have a long-standing personal relationship. But I think what you`re going to see from Senator McCain is a move toward a more mainstream Republican hawk. He will likely not follow Governor Palin`s move toward Donald Trump. But whether McCain could really lift someone, let`s say, in New Hampshire, where he`s won twice in 2000, 2008, it probably will have the same impact as someone like Governor Palin. So, a voice like McCain still matters in a state like New Hampshire. But in this race, it`s all conservative. It`s all about the fear of “Duck Dynasty” stars and Sarah Palin and all these different voices who are not elected leaders. They`re the power players. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Robert, the last time we spoke, you had just reported that Republican big dollar donors were starting to look at the rise of Ted Cruz and the sort of top tier the – emerging firm top tier of doesn`t Donald Cruz and – Donald Cruz – Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, were start to think about apply thing their trout with Donald Trump even though that might have been unlikely earlier in the process. Now in these few days since you initially reported that, are you starting to see that idea spread that between Cruz and Trump, the donors are happier with Trump? COSTA: Yes, I do. They see Trump as non-ideological. They see in Cruz, someone who`s strident, who`s close to the base, who`s not really a deal maker. They want a dealmaker. The most striking thing to happen on the establishment side today was Iowa Governor Terry Branstad speaking out against Cruz. You now see the establishment class looking at Trump and Cruz as perhaps the likely nominees and beginning to make decisions and picking sides. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Robert Costa, reporter for “The Washington Post” – thanks very much for your time, Robert. Appreciate it tonight. COSTA: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Again, Robert`s story on this subject and the impact of the Palin endorsement among other things is going to be A1 in “The Washington Post” tomorrow morning. All right. We`re going to be talking just a few minutes to Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders live from Iowa. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' After turning out a whopping 7,000 people last night in Birmingham, Alabama, of all places, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is just right now wrapping up another pretty good-sized event in Sioux City, Iowa. With just two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders is making a big push in Iowa. He`s got four separate events on his Iowa schedule just for today. He and Secretary Clinton, of course, are very close in the Iowa polls. Senator Sanders also just got news from the state that goes next right after Iowa. A brand-new poll just out tonight shows Bernie Sanders with a 27-point lead in New Hampshire. Not like he has 27 percent of the vote. He`s leading Hillary Clinton by a margin of 27 points. Bernie Sanders has just hit 60 percent in this new New Hampshire poll just out from CNN and WMUR. Senator Bernie Sanders is going to be here live with us momentito. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It`s been just over a month since the mayor of Flint, Michigan, declared a state of emergency in the lead poisoned city and today, look, she was at the White House meeting with Obama administration officials. Here she is with senior advisor Valerie Jarrett. She also met with the president himself today. She talked about what Flint needs now, now that the population of that city has been lead poisoned and their water infrastructure has been basically ruined because of actions by the Rick Snyder administration, the state government. President Obama issued his own emergency declaration for Flint over the weekend and tomorrow, he says he`s dispatching Nicole Lurie, the official you see her to Flint. She`s from the Health and Human Services Department. Most recently, she led the domestic response to Ebola in the United States. She`s a very experienced public health person. She`s going to be taking lead for the federal government on the crisis in Flint. The White House says President Obama will not personally be visiting Flint when he travels to Michigan tomorrow. But Flint and its lead contaminated water are now the focus of sustained national attention including political attention. The two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have made the Flint crisis a big part of their campaigns. Hillary Clinton`s campaign arranged a conference call with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and reporters today. It was ostensibly about the situation in Flint and what the Clinton campaign was trying to do to help. But on that call, the mayor made unexpected political news when she was asked if she was ready to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. You can actually hear the Clinton campaign staffers reacting with surprise in this recording of the call. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MAYOR KAREN WEAVER (D), FLINT, MI: We want a friend like Hillary in the White House. That`s exactly what we need to have happen because we know that this isn`t something that`s going to go away and we need a fighter. You know, we need someone there fighting for the city of Flint and making sure we`re getting what we deserved to have happen and Hillary Clinton has shown us she`s ready to take that on. REPORTER: So, it sounds like you`re endorsing her for president. WEAVER: Yes, it does sound like it, doesn`t it? I love Hillary. (END AUDIO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Some of the people react were Hillary Clinton staffers going, oh, I guess we just got an endorsement. That may have been the first time a mayor of Flint, Michigan, has been asked by the national press to make a presidential be endorsement. I don`t know. But that is just how much things have changed in the last month that winning the Flint mayor`s endorsement really counts for something right now. And so does knowing enough about Flint to talk about it on the campaign trail. Bernie Sanders for example, he didn`t win the Flint mayor`s endorsement today, but in one way, he has gone further in his response to Flint than Secretary Clinton has. Senator Sanders now has repeatedly called for the Michigan governor to resign office over this crisis. Governor Snyder told “The National Journal” yesterday that he does not plan to resign. But the possibility that he will resign is starting to creep into the regular local coverage of this scandal. The governor gets asked all the time now if he is going to step down. There`s also renewed attention locally to the lieutenant governor of the state who would take over if Snyder did step down. The governor has been under enormous pressure and criticism for this disaster. Protests have spread from Flint itself to Ann Arbor to the state capital of Lansing tonight, as Rick Snyder was named in two new class action lawsuits filed today and as governor Snyder stepped to the rostrum this evening to deliver his annual state of the state address. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), MICHIGAN: Tonight will be a different state of the state address. There`s so much we could discuss about how we can make our great state even better, stronger, over the next year. But tonight, I will address the crisis in Flint first and in depth. To begin, I`d like to address the people of Flint. Your families face a crisis. A crisis you did not create and could not have prevented. I want to speak directly, honestly and sincerely to let you know we are praying for you, we are working hard for you, and we are absolutely committed to taking the right steps to effectively solve this crisis. To you, the people of Flint, I say tonight, as I have before, I am sorry and I will fix it. No citizen of this great state should endure this kind of catastrophe. Government failed you. Federal, state and local leaders by breaking the trust you placed in us. I`m sorry, most of us all, that I let you down. You deserve better. You deserve accountability. You deserve to know that the buck stops here with me. Most of all, you deserve to know the truth, and I have a responsibility to tell the truth. The truth about what we`ve done, and what we`ll do to overcome this challenge. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Governor`s remarks tonight in the state of the state address. The only micro-fact check I would make on the governor`s remarks is when he said government failed you, federal, state and local leaders by breaking the trust. In this case, local leaders were not at fault. Local leaders had been replaced in Flint by the people who reported only to the governor. They used the emergency management statute in Michigan to replace local leaders with emergency managers who reported to Rick Snyder and those are the people who made the decision that resulted in the poisoning. That is how this started. As protesters yelled outside while he spoke at this address tonight, Governor Snyder did spend a solid 15 minutes of his speech addressing the issue of Flint. He said, tomorrow, he`s going to release his own e-mails from the past two years related to Flint, something the local press has been hounding him to do. He plans to send more National Guard troops to Flint tomorrow as well. He asked the legislature today for another $28 million for Flint and he made a point of saying that services will be available for Flint kids who have high blood lead levels or who may have had high levels which, of course means all of Flint`s kids, every single one of them who drank that water. But some big questions are still left unanswered. What about the governor`s I mails are not from 2015 or but 2013 when the emergency manager his speech addressing the issue of Flint. Tomorrow he`s going to release his own e-mails from the past two years related to Flint, something the local press has been hounding him to do. He plans to send more National Guard troops to Flint tomorrow. He asked the legislature today for another $28 million for Flint and he made a point of saying that services will be available for Flint kids who have high blood lead levels or who may have had high levels which, of course, means all of Flint`s kids, every single one of them who drank that water. But some big questions are still left unanswered. What about the governor`s emails not from 2015 or 2014 but 2013 when the emergency manager he pointed made the initial decision to drink from the Flint River. And Governor Snyder said nothing about the exorbitant bills charged to Flint residents for water they could not drink and still can`t and whether those bills will be refunded or forgiven. The biggest question is whether his speech tonight will convince the people of Michigan he`s up to the task of fixing this problem or do anything to quell the calls for his resignation. The presidential candidate who has spoken out most forcefully on that point, on the governor`s potential resignation over this scandal, Senator Bernie Sanders joins us live next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Joining us now for the interview tonight, live from Underwood, Iowa, is Bernie Sanders – the independent senator from Vermont, contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. Senator Sanders, it`s great to see you. Thanks very much for being with us tonight. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My pleasure. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Senator, I want to talk with you about Flint, Michigan. I want to talk with you about some of what`s going on between you and Secretary Clinton in the race right now. We`re going to get to that. But there is – a couple of other things have just happened on the campaign trail today that I`d just like to get your reaction too to first if you don`t mind. The first one is this very sad news from the Ben Carson campaign that one of Ben Carson`s volunteers was killed in a car crash today on an icy road in Iowa. I just wanted to know if you`ve reached out to Dr. Carson or if you have any thoughts on that today. SANDERS: Well, actually, Rachel, I`m right now in Sioux City, Iowa. We just had a rally here. One of the first things I did do is mention the fact that a young man, a volunteer who works for Dr. Carson died on the roads here, very slippery roads here in Iowa. And, you know, clearly, Dr. Carson and I don`t have much in common politically. But the fact is when you have kids getting involved in the political process, doing their best to elect the candidates of their choice, that`s what the American democracy is about. So, we issued a statement and I will call up Dr. Carson to send our condolences. You know, when it`s just a tragedy that a young man involved in volunteering at a political campaign should lose his life. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, a 25-year-old man. That`s very sad. Senator, you called a few days ago for Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to resign over the lead poisoning of Flint. He gave his State of the State speech tonight in Michigan, talked about Flint at length it was h. He was emotional at times. He`s clearly taking, you know, significant responsibility for that. He said tonight he won`t stop working on this mess until it is fixed. Do you still stand by your call for him to resign? Do you think he is not the man to fix this problem? SANDERS: But, Rachel, you know, I don`t go around every other day calling for governors to resign. I don`t think I ever have. And I heard Governor Snyder in your report talk about his prayers for the people of Flint and that`s fine. But the truth is, this is one of the worst public health crises in modern American history. We don`t know the full extent of the crisis. We know that thousands of children and others have been poisoned. We don`t know how many will end up with brain damage. But clearly, this is a horrific, horrific public health crisis. And I think that in terms of the governor`s office, there has been a real dereliction of duty. I think it`s not good enough to be talking about prayers. It`s important to say, listen, we certainly didn`t mean to do that, but we screwed up terribly and people will be paying the price for this for their entire lives, how many we don`t know, and the right thing in my view to do is to resign. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You brought up the subject of Flint without being asked about it in the last debate as did Secretary Clinton. You both mentioned it at the end of the debates. It was very large reaction from the crowd when you did that. This is obviously something that moves people. And I think in general the debates have been really illuminating and have brought forward a lot of things that people necessarily didn`t expect. They`ve been spontaneous and they`ve really moved the campaign forward. That`s just my perception as an observer. You have been loudly critical of the Democratic Party`s debate schedule in this primary. The last three debates for the Democratic side have been on weeks. There are no more scheduled Democratic debates before Iowa or New Hampshire. In contrast, the Republicans have another one next week and then they`ve got another one before New Hampshire. Is this lack of debates on the Democratic side and hiding them in these obscure places in the schedule, is it a big enough problem that you and the other candidates might revolt and try to at least get another one scheduled? SANDERS: Well, look, you know, when the Republicans do primetime debates they get 20 million, 25 million people watching it. When we have debates, the one here in Iowa was literally on the night of a huge football game. It was Iowa State versus the University of Iowa. Probably the worst time that you could possibly schedule a debate. If we want to win in November, it is important that the American people hear our ideas. And debates are one way that millions of people can hear our ideas and hear the differences between the candidates. So, I think we have got to do a lot better than that. But, by the way, when I talk about the Democratic Party and leadership, it is not just debate scheduling. We need, Rachel, a 50-state strategy. I was just in Alabama yesterday. The problems facing the African-American community in cities like Birmingham, Alabama, are mind-blowing. We don`t talk about it. What I learned was incredible. I mean, you`ve got what they call a 21st century Jim Crow. The Alabama Democratic Party as well as many other Democratic Parties around the country have been written off by the Democratic leadership. Somebody there told me they got a check for $5,000. That`s crazy stuff. We need to defend working people and we need to defend people of color in 50 states in this country. And one of the points that I made yesterday in Alabama that if elected president, we are going to have a 50-state strategy. We are going to bring new people, new energy, working people, young people, into the political process. That`s what this campaign is doing, and that`s what I will do as president. The way Republicans win election is when people get demoralized, when people give up on the political process and when we have low voter turnouts. So, yes, the scheduling for the debates has been a disaster. We should be ashamed. As a Democratic party that voter turnouts are so low. We have got to reignite energy in this country and get people excited about the political process. And when we have large voter turnouts as I think our campaign can bring about, we`re not going to only – not only will we win – regain the presidency, we`re going to retake the Senate, do very well in the House and in governors` races around the country. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Senator, I`m going to press you on this one part of it and it`s not because I`m trying to foment any sort of revolt here. I`m really not. But I`m trying to follow on what you said. And thinking about in particular those Democratic polities in those Deep South states so many of which are going to be voting early this year, they`re going to be voting on March 1st when there`s a lot of Southern states are very early in the process because of the way the primary calendar has been changed up this year. Given that you feel like in particular southern states aren`t getting their due from the Democratic Party, given that you feel like the Democratic Party screwed up in the way they scheduled these debates, given that you said from the very beginning that there ought to be more of these debates, I feel like the candidates are sort of more important in this process than the party is, do you and Governor O`Malley and Secretary Clinton – do you envisage the three of you getting together and telling the party to stuff it and doing it the way that I`ve heard all three of you articulate you`d rather do it? SANDERS: Well, count me in as one person – you know, if Secretary Clinton and Governor O`Malley want to do it, I`m there. I love debates. I think they are a way to inform the American people of our positions and our differences. So, I think that is a great idea. So, I`m in. If the other candidates are in, you count me in. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m never the one who starts these things but I feel like I might be starting something here. Senator, let me ask you about another issue in terms of the way the campaign is going forward. Your policies on issues like gay rights and reproductive choice are very consistent. They should be very attractive to progressive groups. But there`s been a series of high profile endorsements of groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL, they`ve gone out of their way to make very early endorsements for Secretary Clinton. Just today, Human Rights Campaign, the gay rights group, announced their Clinton endorsement. Are you competing for those groups` endorsements and not getting them, or are you not trying to get them? SANDERS: Look – no, Rachel, I would love to have the endorsement of every progressive organization in America. We`re very proud to have received recently the endorsement of MoveOn.org. We`ve received the endorsement Democracy for America. These are grassroots organizations representing millions of workers. What we are doing in this campaign, it just blows my mind every day because I see it clearly, we`re taking on not only Wall Street and economic establishment, we`re taking on the political establishment. So, I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood. But, you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment. I will challenge anybody with regard to my record on LGBT issues. You know, I was one of the few, relatively few to oppose and vote against DOMA, et cetera. In terms of women`s rights, I believe we have a 100 percent life-time pro-choice record. But, you know, that`s what happens in politics. Look, I`m going to do well and hopefully win, not because of the establishment support. What we are going to do well at and what we are doing well at is rallying the grassroots of this country. We`ve been going all over the country, having just huge turnouts of people coming to our rallies. We have two and half million individual campaign contributions, more than any campaign in history. So, Rachel, I can see – you know, I`m not going to get establishment support. I`m not going to get the support of the governors and the senators, with few exceptions, and many of the major organizations. But the reason that we are doing so well, why we`re ahead now I believe in New Hampshire, why we`re closing the gap in Iowa, why we`re gaining, why we are gaining in Nevada and South Carolina, and why we`re doing better and better all over the country is not from the establishment. It is from the grassroots of America. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joining us from Iowa tonight. Sir, thank you very much for your time. I know it`s been a really long day for you and I really appreciate you giving us this time tonight. Thank you, sir. SANDERS: Thank you very much, Rachel. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. Talk to you soon. We`ve got much more ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Today, a weird thing happened. A bill that was passed with a unanimous vote by a state legislature, unanimous, was nevertheless vetoed by that state`s governor. I`m not going to tell you who was but I will tell you that that governor is currently applying for a much bigger job. You will not believe the thing he just did. That story is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' One of the more unusual ways to find yourself cursed in our time is to live in a state where your governor has decided to run for president. Even if it works out well for your governor, it almost never works out well for your state. Take for example, New Jersey. Not known for its easygoing politics in the best of times. But, recently, New Jersey politicians came together to pass a bill unanimously, unanimous support from both parties. The law already says in New Jersey that you can`t have a gun if you`re a person who`s been convicted of any of a whole long list of serious crimes like homicide, kidnapping, robbery, aggravated assault, stalking, sexual assault, certain drug crimes, domestic violence. Like a lot of states, if you`ve been convicted of a crime like that, you can`t have a gun in New Jersey that is settled law. Last year, New Jersey Republicans and Democrats unanimously voted to add a few other serious crimes in that list. They added carjacking, gang criminality, racketeering or terroristic threats. So, convicted carjackers, and gang members and racketeers, people who have made terroristic threats, you can`t have guns in New Jersey. Along with convicted kidnappers and murderers and burglars and all the rest. It`s a unanimous vote, bipartisan vote – the definition of noncontroversial, as long as your governor is not running for president. Today, the “convicted carjackers can`t have guns” bill was vetoed by Chris Christie. This bill had zero opposition. It was 37-to-nothing in the Senate, 68-to-nothing in the assembly. Nobody was opposed to the bill except for Chris Christie because, of course, he`s expecting a big endorsement for the carjackers league of New Hampshire or something. It`s just amazing. Congratulations, New Jersey. You want your next governor to run for president, too? That does it for us tonight. We will see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”. Good evening, Lawrence.  ']\n",

And in the Democratic Party, it`s who do Democrats want to vote for – HAYES: Right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' – in the Democratic Party after Barack Obama. Both totally open questions at this point. HAYES: And we don`t know anything. That`s what makes this interesting. ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s what makes it fun coming to work every day. Thanks, my friend. And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Happy Martin Luther King Day. And in addition, if you are a resident of Mississippi, Alabama, or Arkansas, technically, I should also wish you happy Robert E. Lee Day. I`m not kidding. In those three states, they have decided to celebrate their official state observance of Martin Luther King`s birthday coincident with an additional state holiday celebrated on the same day to commemorate one of the Confederate generals from the American civil war. People don`t believe me – I try to say this every year. I try to do this as a little public service reminder. People do not believe me. But look. It`s true. This is the official announcement on the website of the great state of Mississippi. You see it there in the upper left-hand corner, the secretary of state official seal for Mississippi. And then there`s the listing for today`s holiday in Mississippi. Martin Luther King and is Robert E. Lee`s birthdays. Both celebrated the third Monday in January. That`s Mississippi. Here it is on the website, official website of the state of Alabama. They just conveniently put it on this little calendar. And you can see on their calendar they actually put Robert E. Lee first. In Alabama today is Robert E. Lee/Martin Luther King`s birthday. And on the calendar actually right next to today`s date that got a little thumbs up. In Arkansas, and this is a particularly awkward listing, you can download the announcement of the joint holiday honoring both Martin Luther King and Robert E. Lee from the Arkansas state website. And Arkansas state government conveniently gives you the choice of downloading that holiday bulletin either in color or in black and white. Maybe, you know, you can post them over the drinking fountain or whatever. Today, marks the 30th year that Martin Luther King`s birthday has been honored as a federal holiday. President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into federal law in 1983. It was observed for the first time federally in 1986, 30 years ago today. But because of ongoing conservative opposition to any sort of honor for Dr. King, even though the federal observance technically started 30 years ago, it was not until the year 2000 that every last begrudging state in the Union finally started to celebrate it. And again, I swear, believe me when I tell you, Alabama and Mississippi and Arkansas still only celebrate it by combining it with an equal honor for a slave-holding confederate general. Today on the campaign trail, as best as we can tell, most of the Republican presidential field did not do special events or go to special commemorations for Martin Luther King day today. One exception is Ben Carson. Dr. Carson rode in a parade in a very snazzy black convertible in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He participated in that king day event. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump does not appear to have gone anywhere or done anything that he was not already going to do today because of the holiday specifically. But when Mr. Trump did give a speech today at Liberty University, he did in his own inimitable Donald Trump way, give Dr. King kind of a shout out, which also managed to be all about himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Wow. Oh, this is so – you get those teleprompters out of here. We`re going to have some fun, right? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Get those teleprompters. We have a president – you know, our president. And I`m not talking about this – I`m talking about that president. We don`t like those teleprompters. I will say this. It`s an honor to be here and especially on Martin Luther King Day. We broke the record. You know, we had the record for about three or four years the last time. And the first thing I said to Jerry and Becky when I got here, did we break the record? They said yes, you did, by quite a bit. So, we`ll dedicate that to Martin Luther King, a great man. And that`s a little bit of an achievement, I will tell you. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' To be clear, the achievement he is talking about there is his own crowd size, which he has decided to sign over as an accolade to the memory of Martin Luther King on the occasion of the federal observance of his birthday. On the Democratic side, all three Democratic presidential candidates woke up today in South Carolina after their South Carolina debate last night, and incidentally, we just got the audience figure, speaking of crowd size, for the NBC debate last night in South Carolina. This had been expected to be a bit of a bust in terms of viewership because they scheduled it for Sunday night in the middle of a holiday weekend when most people have Monday off. In fact, the debate did pretty well. It did better than the last two Democratic debates, got over 10 million viewers on NBC last night. So, that was last night. South Carolina. This morning all three Democratic candidates participated in events in South Carolina to commemorate Martin Luther King Day. There was a prayer breakfast. There was a march. There was also this year`s observation of what has basically become a modern civil rights tradition in South Carolina. It`s called King Day at the Dome. Every year, civil rights groups and politicians and South Carolinians convene at the state house in South Carolina on Martin Luther King Day. And it`s usually basically a protest of the fact that the Confederate flag is still flying on the state house grounds in South Carolina. That`s what this day has been for years in that state. Well, this year, for the first time, King Day at the dome was among other things a celebration of that flag being down once and for all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN O`MALLEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It`s wonderful to be here in South Carolina facing the rising sun of this new day begun and to be here in the absence of the Confederate battle flag. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hello, South Carolina! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) What a beautiful morning for King Day at the Dome, and how wonderful it is to be here together without the Confederate flag overhead. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) That flag always belonged in a museum, not at the state house. I want to thank Governor Haley and the legislature for finally taking it down. And, by the way, Brie Newsom deserves credit too for doing what a lot of people wanted to do, shimmying up that flagpole. But you know who else deserves credit? Each and every one of you, because every year you`ve gathered right here and said that that symbol of division and racism went against everything Dr. King stood for. We couldn`t celebrate him and the confederacy. We had to choose. And South Carolina finally made the right choice. Oh, I know that some of you have never missed a single King Day at the dome. And I hope you feel a lot of pride today, because a lot of people are grateful to you, not just in South Carolina but across our country. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this morning while speaking at the South Carolina state capitol. When she mentioned Brie Newsom there, do you remember who that is? She was talking about the activist who took the Confederate flag down herself as an act of civil disobedience before the South Carolina legislature voted to take it down. You probably remember that just very dramatic footage of her climbing that flagpole. She was wearing climbing gear, grabbing the flag in her hands and then her coming down. Praying out loud as she very peacefully submitted to being arrested for having done that. That was illegal, what Brie Newsom did that day. And that`s why she got arrested for it. But what she did, taking down the flag, is now truth. It`s now the law of the land in South Carolina. And the flag is down. And so, she got that shout out today from Hillary Clinton as a direct action activist for helping make what happened in South Carolina possible. I should tell you that we think, we cannot promise but we think that we might be getting a phone interview, a live phone interview with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this hour. It`s a bit of logistic – the reason I think, it`s because it`s a little bit of a logistical matter. Secretary Clinton just wrapped up a campaign event in Iowa. We are hoping to catch her before the end of this hour. It`s a little dicey in terms of the logistics, what we think we`re getting here. I will keep you posted. We might be speaking to Hillary Clinton live in just a moment. Today marks two weeks exactly until the Iowa caucuses. Even though she and Senator Sanders both got pretty high marks from observers in terms of their performance in last night`s debate, it is Secretary Clinton who got the very, very good news today in polling. Today, the new NBC News/”Wall Street Journal” national poll came out on the Democratic presidential nomination and that poll has Secretary Clinton leading Senator Sanders by 25 points nationwide. Clinton at 59, Sanders at 34, and Martin O`Malley trailing way behind at 2 percent. Again, a national poll, NBC/”Wall Street Journal.” Interestingly, though, in addition to that straight up polling, Nate Silver`s Web site, fivethirtyeight.com has also started doing its state by state predictions. And it`s a little controversial. What they do at fivethirtyeight.com is looking at not just straight up polls but also other things like endorsements that they think are important factors for predicting who`s going to win a particular state. At fivethirtyeight.com, they combine polling with a whole bunch of other kinds of data and thereby produce a percentage likelihood for who they expect to win in each state. They don`t predict how much they think they`re going to win by. They just predict who they think is going to win. What the likelihood is that one candidate or the other will win. And whether or not you like that kind of hybrid approach where you combine polling with other data, whether or not you like that form of analysis or are comfortable with it, I should tell you this system at fivethirtyeight.com correctly predicted the outcome of every single state, plus the District of Columbia in the 2012 presidential race. So, it is of interest. And today, exactly two weeks from Iowa, fivethirtyeight.com says the likelihood that Hillary Clinton will win Iowa is 80 percent. Bernie Sanders likely, 20 percent likely to win. Hillary Clinton 80 percent likely to win. And look at this, this is New Hampshire. If you just look at straight- ahead polling in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders is ahead by a pretty good margin in that state. But fivethirtyeight.com today says that Hillary Clinton actually has a 57 percent chance of winning in New Hampshire and Bernie Sanders has a 43 percent chance of winning in New Hampshire. Those predictions again are just predictions. But they have to be very satisfying predictions for the Hillary Clinton campaign coming off of last night`s debate. Again, because of the ridiculous Democratic Party debate schedule. There will not be another Democratic debate before the voting in the Iowa caucuses on February 1st and the New Hampshire primary on February 9th. Now, on the Republican side, fivethirtyeight.com has also put out its predictions for both New Hampshire and Iowa. On the Republican side in New Hampshire, it looks like a heck of a race. Fivethirtyeight.com today says that Donald Trump has the highest possibility of winning New Hampshire, but they still only give him a 39 percent chance of winning. And yes, that`s higher than everybody else, but it`s still not all that high. Marco Rubio according to their calculations, has the second highest probability of winning New Hampshire according to fivethirtyeight.com. He`s at 19 percent. But that`s a tough one, New Hampshire. In Iowa, this is fascinating. You`ve seen all the recent polling that puts Ted Cruz in the catbird`s seat in Iowa. Fivethirtyeight.com as of today, they do pick Ted Cruz as the most likely Republican to win in Iowa but they only give him a 51 percent chance of winning. So, if you believe fivethirtyeight.com and their hybrid prediction model of combining polling with endorsements and other data, if you believe them the Democratic race is not as close as it might otherwise appear. And the Republican race is even closer than you think. We will talk – if the logistical gods concur, we will be talking with Hillary Clinton about that and much more in just a moment, coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Look at this big room. This is an event that is under way right now. I think just wrapping up right now in Birmingham, Alabama. Look at the size of that room. This is a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, of all places, held as you can see here by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. This is tonight. Really big turnout, obviously. Senator Sanders was introduced at tonight`s rally by Professor Cornel West. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton both started the day today in South Carolina. Senator Sanders then went to Alabama. Secretary Clinton then flew from South Carolina to Iowa. And then after her Iowa event tonight, in a hot minute she`s going to be talking to me. That`s just ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' When Ronald Reagan ran against President Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of 1980, one of the huge national security issues that hung over that election like a rain cloud was the more than 60 Americans who`d been held as hostages by Iran since November the previous year. Iran had its fundamentalist revolution in 1979. In November 1979, radicals stormed the U.S. embassy and took all those Americans hostage. And then the following year, nearly a year into that ordeal, while the U.S. presidential election was coming to its end, Iran`s view of the world and of its most pressing problems in the world changed pretty dramatically because Iran got invaded. In September 1980, Saddam Hussein`s Iraq invaded their much larger neighbor to the east. Iraq launched a full-scale conventional warfare invasion of Iran and thus started the unbelievably bloody Iran-Iraq war which would go on for eight solid years without a break and that would kill more than a million people including lots and lots and lots of kids. So, that started, the terrible Iran-Iraq War started. It started five weeks before the U.S. presidential election in 1980. And even though Iran by that point had been holding all these Americans hostage for more than a year, Iran decided that they would do a deal to let the American hostages out. And one of the reasons why is that they knew the deal would involve a lot of money. One of the things they would be trading the hostages for was the freeing up of Iranian assets. And they desperately needed that because of the giant conventional land war they had just entered into with one of their neighboring countries. They needed the money. And so, as President Carter campaigned for his re-election in the 1980 campaign, Carter administration officials were hard at work in negotiation with the Iranians to get the American hostages out. And the Iranians, by all accounts, really hated President Jimmy Carter. I mean, they hated America generally but they particularly hated President Carter. And they negotiated a deal to free the hostages that would go into effect the day that President Carter left office. And so, Ronald Reagan had his Inauguration Day. At 8:31 that morning, the outgoing president jimmy carter advised the incoming president, Ronald Reagan, oh, by the way, the hostages are getting out today. And then, Ronald Reagan was sworn in and in Tehran the planes carrying the hostages took off. At 2:00 in the afternoon that day the newly sworn-in President Ronald Reagan was able to make the announcement that at long last after 14 months those hostages were coming home. And then the first thing that he did as a former president, Jimmy Carter, who negotiated the release of the prisoners and who got it done as his last act as president, the first thing he did as a former president is that he flew to Germany to greet the freed Americans. And the crowd held signs that said, “Thanks, Jimmy.” He did it. Took him to the last moments of his presidency but he got them out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Which is true. But he didn`t do it. Ronald Reagan didn`t do it by waving a magic wand as soon as he got inaugurated. Jimmy Carter did it. It`s funny, though. This year`s Republican presidential candidates, they like to bring up Ronald Reagan whenever Iran comes up in any conversation. Rand Paul did it at that same debate where you just saw Ted Cruz was speaking. Chris Christie randomly brought up Ronald Reagan in his first campaign ad about Iran. This weekend, Marco Rubio raised the specter of President Reagan while he lambasted the Obama administration for getting four Americans freed this weekend from Iranian prisons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK TODD, MEET THE PRESS: So, under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDDIDATE: When I was – when I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama. And it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office, the hostages were released from Iran. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Because Jimmy Carter made the arrangements. It really wasn`t magic. But Senator Rubio is saying essentially that he himself is like Ronald Reagan in that he would never trade anything with Iran. He would never negotiate with Iran on American prisoners or anything. Just like Ronald Reagan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that`s true. But the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' After Jimmy Carter got the 1979-1980 era American hostages freed from Iran, President Reagan during his presidency had to deal with a new slew of American hostages, taken by groups supported by Iran, particularly in Lebanon, and not only did President Reagan negotiate with Iran to try to get those Americans freed, he negotiated a deal that involved illegally shipping Iran a bunch of weapons in secret. And did I mention it wasn`t legal? And it didn`t work. And it was the biggest scandal of his presidency and one of the larger and more salacious presidential scandals of all time, particularly since it resulted at one point in the criminal indictment of most of the president`s serving national security staff. But that, Ronald Reagan, that is who today`s Republican presidential candidates like to cite as a role model for handling Iran. They like to cite the president who made an Iran deal so bad that he secretly sold Iran weapons and he still didn`t get the hostages out. The great and big-hearted E.J. Dionne at “The Washington Post” has an excellent book out called “Why the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism from Goldwater to the Tea Party and Beyond.” And it is a great book, and the central thesis of the book is, that I`m quoting E.J. here, “The history of American conservatism is a story of disappointment and betrayal.” In the opening chapters of the book are about Ronald Reagan and among other things, this fascinating and weird development in our time in which Ronald Reagan is basically deliberately misremembered on the right. How Ronald Reagan`s real record has been submarined and all of his faults and compromises have been ascribed to other people and not to him. So, conservatives can have one hero in modern history about whom they don`t feel terrible disappointment and betrayal. They basically reinvented Reagan as perfect. Even on Iran of all things, because they need something to believe in, even if it`s fake. But because he`s E.J. Dionne, he says it much more nicely than that and with way more footnotes. Joining us now is the great and big-hearted “Washington Post” columnist E.J. Dionne. E.J., it`s great to see you. Congratulations on this. E.J. DIONNE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Thank you so much. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I – the whole book is not about Reagan, but this element of Reagan being remembered as perfect because modern conservatives need a hero is a very evocative thesis to me. DIONNE: Well, I think it`s absolutely true. And right at the beginning of the book I quote a conservative Charles Krauthammer who says you can choose your Reagan. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. DIONNE: Because I think one of the ways in which conservatives can hold Ronald Reagan up is – there`s different kinds of conservatives, remember different Reagans. A lot of the Tea Party conservatives remember the movement Reagan. At the beginning I quote Chris McDaniel, that right-wing candidate down in Mississippi who remembers this really hard-line Reagan. And then I quote Governor Haley Barbour who remembers Ronald Reagan as a very flexible guy. Purity is the enemy of victory says Hailey Barbour. But if you actually go back at that time, there were a lot of conservatives who were very critical of Reagan, among other things for being too dovish. He committed those troops to Lebanon. I was there at the time. It was a terrible mistake. But then he pulled them out. And he – ', 'MADDOW:', ' He said he wouldn`t pull them out and then he pulled them out. Yes. DIONNE: Which was the right thing to do. Only it was too late. There were conservatives who criticized him for not sending troops down to Central America. But I think one of the things that saved Reagan is the presidency of George H.W. Bush. In a way, George H.W. Bush died for Ronald Reagan`s sins, because when Reagan raised taxes seven or eight times that didn`t matter, but when Bush raised taxes, that became a great sin. ', 'MADDOW:', ' He became sort of a heat shield in that sense? Anything that Reagan had done that conservatives didn`t like, they decided it was a Poppy Bush problem. DIONNE: Exactly. And I think the border problem is – I appreciate your doing the opening sentence because I think this sense of betrayal on the part of conservatives, even if they hold Reagan off, reflects the fact that ever since Goldwater`s time, and I take it all the way back to Goldwater, conservative politicians have had to make a series of promises to the conservative base that they couldn`t possibly keep. They promised a much smaller government but the country doesn`t really want it. Even Tea Partiers who are on Social Security and Medicare don`t want a smaller government. They promised to roll back cultural change, but guess what? Most of the country actually supports the cultural changes since the 1960s. Most of the country supports equality between men and women. Now, most of the country supports gay marriage. So, you have all these conservatives out there who feel we elect our guys and then they don`t get done the things that they said they get done, and I think that gives us this campaign, where Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are the two leading candidates of the primaries. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And the – I mean, it`s not incidental that Goldwater who sets this tone is the Goldwater who lost and never had to govern by the principles that he was articulating. And the Goldwater who ended up repenting later in life when some of his hardest-line positions is one who would have not been welcome in the party today. DIONNE: Right. And Ronald Reagan did a lot of things that would not be welcomed in the party today as well. And when you look at – I also had a lot of fun in the book talking about Richard Nixon because Richard Nixon is such an ambiguous figure. In some ways he was one of the most liberal presidents we have had if you look at the creation of EPA, the creation of the Occupational Safety Administration, but he was also one of the hardest- line presidents on race, on law and order. And if you go back to history, his staff reflected this double mind of Richard Nixon. And again, he really contributed to this cycle of disappointment on the right. ', 'MADDOW:', ' E.J. Dionne, the book is “Why the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism From Goldwater To The Tea Party and Beyond.” Everybody keeps talking about Donald Trump and to a lesser extent Ted Cruz like they`re a big surprise. This is the explanation of why it`s not a surprise. Congratulations. DIONNE: Thank you so much, Rachel. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. We`ve got much more ahead. And if all goes well, I`ll be speaking with Hillary Clinton in a second. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what`s happening in Flint, Michigan. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) And I think every single American should be outraged. We`ve had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead- contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn`t really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled. I`ll tell you what. If the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Secretary Clinton was right, and what I did, which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of the governor – a man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' The Democratic presidential candidates were not asked last night about the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan. But first Hillary Clinton and then Bernie Sanders went out of their way to bring it up of their own accord at the close of the debate last night. This weekend, on Saturday, President Obama granted Michigan Governor Rick Snyder`s request for a federal emergency declaration in Flint. That frees up $5 million in federal money for bottled water, water filters, and lead testing kits. So, the president said yes to the federal emergency declaration. But the president said no to Governor Snyder`s request that the federal government should also spend tens of millions of dollars to replace Flint`s ruined water pipes. The Snyder administration is appealing that part of the decision. But even if the state wins that appeal and gets everything it has asked for, it would still just be a fraction of what Flint needs. In Governor Snyder`s letter to the president this weekend requesting help, the governor estimates that the total cost of replacing Flint`s damaged water infrastructure is more like 3/4 of a billion dollars. They`re not asking for anywhere near that. Whether or not they get it. Where`s that kind of money going to come from? Especially because the only reason the pipes are all ruined is because of something the Snyder administration did. President Obama is heading to Detroit the day after tomorrow. He`s going to be there on Wednesday. No word on whether he might pay a visit to Flint on that trip. But it is only about an hour`s drive north. Just saying. When pressed in an interview with the “National Journal” tonight, Governor Rick Snyder said that it is fair to call the Flint crisis his Katrina. He also said in that same interview that he is not considering resigning as governor but he said he is considering releasing all of his e-mails released to the flint crisis, something he has not yet done, but that the “Flint Journal” and the “Detroit Free Press” are now basically hounding him daily to do. To top it all off, tomorrow night, Rick Snyder is scheduled to deliver his State of the State address in the middle of all this. He`s going to have to make the case to the people of Michigan for how he`s going to continue to lead the state when he has become such a poster child for bad governance that the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination is now making his name part of her stump speech. Hillary Clinton talked about Flint again today at a Martin Luther King Day event in South Carolina. She called the Flint water crisis a civil rights issue. Secretary Clinton joins us live, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: When African-American kids are 500 times more likely to die from asthma than white kids and when the children of majority black Flint, Michigan, have been drinking and bathing in lead-poisoned water for more than a year, making sure all Americans have clean air and water isn`t just a health issue. It`s a civil rights issue. We would be outraged if this happened to white kids, and we should be outraged that it`s happening right now to black kids. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Hillary Clinton today in Columbia, South Carolina, saying the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King on his birthday lives on in the national outrage over the lead poisoning of the kids of Flint, Michigan. Joining us now from Iowa is the former secretary of state, Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us tonight. CLINTON (via telephone): Thanks so much, Rachel. It`s good to talk to you again. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I know you are casting Flint, Michigan, as a civil rights issue, which makes it a federal issue by extension. This weekend, President Obama approved $5 million in some limited aid for FEMA. He did deny Michigan`s request for more help to rebuild Flint`s infrastructure. I wanted to know your reaction to that decision by the president. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think it`s really important for the federal government to get in. It`s been unconscionable, as you`ve pointed out, for the residents of an American city to be living with water so dangerous that G.M. won`t even use it because it was corroding their car parts. And I think it`s important that the federal government really push the government of Michigan, particularly Governor Snyder, to ask to set up a comprehensive health monitoring for kids who`ve been exposed. I know that the Obama administration is standing ready to assist, but the governor needs to make the ask. And he needs to make it now for the sake of those children. The state of Michigan also needs to do its part in dealing with the long- term health and infrastructure issues. They created this disaster in the first place through their negligence and incompetence, and the governor and his administration apparently knew or had reason to know that the water was contaminated and chose not to take action. So, this is an environmental (INAUDIBLE) issue, a health issue, in every way that we can imagine a crisis of the first order. So, we`ve got to keep pressing the state to ask for what the federal government can provide, and as I said on your show, we need to keep helping and pushing the federal government to see what it can do to actually intervene and do more for the people. ', 'MADDOW:', ' When you brought up the Flint crisis at the debate last night, you went out of your way to do so. You weren`t asked about it directly but you brought it up. Senator Sanders then talked about it too. Senator Sanders says that he wants Governor Snyder to resign over this issue. The governor of Michigan responded to you two on Twitter. He said, “Political statements and finger-pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.” Do you have any response to that? CLINTON: Well, I do, because thanks to what we have done, and you`ve been a big part of this, the national spotlight is shining on the horrible situation in Flint. And it`s clear that as attention has increased so has the governor`s apparent willingness to deal seriously with the issue. I don`t call that politicizing. I`d call that getting results. And I think we should take advantage of the fact that the country is coming together behind the people of Flint. But I think we`ve got to make sure we do everything we`re supposed to do to help the children and families that have been drinking and bathing in this poisonous lead-contaminated water while their representatives in state government did nothing. That`s why I keep reiterating the governor needs to request comprehensive health monitoring of kids who may have been exposed to lead. I think the state should set up what I think should be called a future fund to take care of children who`ve been poisoned. And looking at where the state of Michigan is, the governor is actually sitting on a budget surplus and a rainy day fund, and as far as I`m concerned, if there were ever a rainy day in Flint, it`s right now and the money should be forthcoming. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Last night`s debate, Madam Secretary, was the last Democratic debate until mid-February. I`m struck by the fact that even though the Republicans just had a debate and they`re about to have another debate before Iowa, there isn`t another Democratic debate before Iowa or before the primary in New Hampshire. Do you wish there were more debates? Are you enjoying these debates when they do happen? CLINTON: I love the debates. I really do. I feel that it gives me a chance to get up on the stage and explain my positions, answer questions from the moderators, draw contrasts with my opponents. So, it`s been a good experience for me so far. And I think it`s helped me make my case for my candidacy. ', 'MADDOW:', ' The sparse Democratic Party debate schedule this year, particularly when compared to the Republicans, a lot of people in the political press have ascribed that to your campaign, have ascribed that decision to your campaign essentially wanting a low-profile and spare debate schedule. Whether or not now looking back you think it was a good decision, is it true that your campaign advocated for a light schedule and particularly these debates being on in TV Siberia, on weekends and holidays? CLINTON: Well, Rachel, I really don`t have any knowledge of that. I`m not saying that nobody representing me or the other campaigns didn`t express an opinion. But it was my understanding that in looking at the sequencing of these debates, looking at the numbers of people who watched back in `08, there was a decision to try to have a monthly debate once people were beginning to pay attention and try to drive more viewership. And actually I believe that we`ve had more viewers on average this year than we did back in `08. So, I`m not going to substitute my judgment for whatever the thought process was. But as to when they`ve been scheduled, again, what I`m told is that they were partnered with broadcast and networks that wanted to provide the time. And indeed for most broadcast networks, Saturday or Sunday was preferable. But because the viewership has been above average, I think people feel like there is a message in their process. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, if you and Senator Sanders and Governor O`Malley ever decide that you want more and you don`t want to negotiate, it you can all just show up here and I`ll help. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: Well, we did have that great forum that you moderated. ', 'MADDOW:', ' In South Carolina. That`s right. CLINTON: I think that got – yes. That got a lot of good response. So, we sure have enough attention to this campaign. So I hope whatever the format is for getting us before the voters, it will encourage even more people to come out and caucus and come out and vote in the primaries. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let me ask you, one last question about the sort of state of the Democratic race. I know that you say you that don`t follow poll to poll and you don`t necessarily think that every poll tells a compelling story. But there`s new polling analysis that`s out today from fivethirtyeight.com and they`ve got a very good predictive track record. And they say that – today that you are more likely than Senator Sanders to win both in Iowa and in New Hampshire, despite his particularly good numbers in New Hampshire right now. If you – if they`re right, if you do beat him and you become the nominee, what is your plan to try to get Senator Sanders`s supporters to back you? We just showed footage of him tonight in Alabama. He`s got this huge crowd. We all know from public information that he`s got millions of individual donors. If you win the nomination, how do you win Bernie Sanders supporters over, especially now that you`re being so tough with him and his record? CLINTON: Well, first of all, Rachel, I don`t pay attention to the polling when it`s good or bad because I think it`s distracting. I`m just going to keep working as hard as I can to convince as many people to support me as possible. So, I don`t want to put any, you know, carts before the horse here. I think it`s important to stay focused on what we have to do in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in Nevada and South Carolina, and then right after South Carolina, we have March 1st, where there`s a large number of states that will be holding contests. But if I am so fortunate as to be the Democratic nominee, I`m going to work as hard as I can to reach out to supporters of my opponents and particularly to help do what I hope would be successful in making the case for their support going into the general election. You know, I remember how hard I had to work back in `08 to convince a lot of my supporters to support President Obama. And you recall, I nominated him at the Democratic Convention in Denver, put my whole self on the line to make the case that whatever differences we might have had in our very long primary, they paled in comparison to the differences we had with the Republicans. And I believed with all my heart, it would be a terrible result if by some combination of misfortune or indifference, the Republicans were to take back the White House. I can`t even imagine everything that would be disrupted and the clock turned back on. So, I`m not going to – I`m not going to talk about what hasn`t happened yet. But if it were to happen, I would work very hard to earn the support of anybody who either supported my opponent or wasn`t involved in the primaries or even people who under normal circumstances might have voted for the Republican Party, but if they nominate someone who is likely to be a very contentious presence in our country, you know, making sure that everybody understands what`s at stake. And I hope I could be successful in doing that. ', 'MADDOW:', ' That last prospect that you raised, are you talking specifically about the Republican front-runner or is there a number of candidates you`re thinking of there? CLINTON: Well, I think a number of them – in fact, all of them – have said things that I find not only factually wrong but divisive and problems we face in the country. I`ve just been coming from an event we had in a small town here in Iowa, and I said, I don`t know who the Republican candidates talk to. They sure aren`t talking to the people I`m talking to or, you know, struggling with three jobs, or trying to afford college or burdened by debt, or unable to pay for their description drug costs, and so many more of the very personal problems people share with me. I don`t know who these people talk to on the other side of the aisle because I think maybe they just have a cast of actors that they move from site to site because they`re sure not hearing the stories and the concerns about what the next president is going to have to try to deal with. And so, I think all of them would be a very bad choice for our country. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former secretary of state, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton – I really appreciate you taking the time to call in tonight from Iowa. Thank you so much, Madam Secretary. CLINTON: Thank you. Good to talk to you. Take care. Bye-bye. ', 'MADDOW:', ' You, too. Thank you. We`ll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' There`s been a pretty remarkable situation unfolding over the last few hours in San Francisco. Earlier tonight, a big group of protesters completely shut down one part of the Bay Bridge, which is the big bridge that connects San Francisco and Oakland. Protesters stopped traffic essentially by driving to the middle of the bridge, stopping their cars, and then chaining themselves to their cars and to each other. The group is apparently an offshoot of the Black Lives Matter movement. They say they took this action on the bay bridge tonight to protest police brutality. There were protests across the Bay Area tonight tying to the Martin Luther King holiday, but this was clearly the most dramatic and most consequential for people who did not expect to be caught up in a major protest today. Traffic on the Bay Bridge shut down for more than 45 minutes. Those lanes have now been reopened. Police say more than a dozens of the protesters were arrested. I`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I like Congress better, but I will say the British parliamentary system has such high standards in terms of expected levels of elocution and oratory from random members of parliament that even if they`re debating like kibble versus wet food, even if they`re debating something that you really do not care about, if it`s happening in the British parliament, it almost always sounds awesome – and not just because of the accents but because they`re really good at debating. So, their debates are fun even when you don`t care. But when they are debating whether or not Donald Trump should be allowed in that country, when they`re debating if he is too odious a person to be allowed to cross their border, that makes their usually fun stuff all the more riveting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL FLYNN, LABOUR MEMBRE OF PARLIAMENT: The first petition has been signed by more people than any other in this parliament. It`s signed by 573,971 signatures. And it calls to block Donald J. Trump from U.K. entry. THOMAS TUGENDHAT, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: Now, while I think this man is crazy, while I think this man has no valid points to make, I will not be the one to silence his voice. PAUL SCULLY, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: I`ve heard of a number of cases where people have been excluded for incitement or for hatred. I`ve never heard of one for stupidity. TULIP SIDDIQ, LABOUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: Hate crime is being inflamed and stroked by the words that Donald Trump is using. JACK DROMEY, LABOUR MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: Donald Trump is a fool. He is free to be a fool. He is not free to be a dangerous fool on our shores. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump is a buffoon. ALEX CHALK, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: Ultimately, buffoonery should not be met with a blunt instrument of a ban but with the classic British response of ridicule. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s not buffoonery, that is absolutely repugnant. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let`s be clear, Donald Trump is an idiot. He`s an idiot. What he is, an idiot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This motion is actually embarrassing to the U.K. and makes us look intolerant and totalitarian. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are simply adding fuel to this whole media circus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Division, hatred, and hostility have no place in our society. VICTORIA ATKINS, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: His policy to close borders if elected as president is bonkers. And if he met one or two of my constituents in one of the excellent pubs in my constituency, then they may well tell him that he is a wazzock. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are united in condemning the comments of Donald Trump. JAMES BROKENSHIRE, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: Best way to defeat nonsense like this is to engage in robust Democratic debate and make it very clear that his, Donald Trump`s views, are not welcome. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Bonkers, a fool, a buffoon, and a wazzock. If the Republican Party chooses Donald Trumps a their presidential nominee and if, yes, it`s possible, he then goes on to win the general election race for president, today in the British parliament, this is a nice little taste of how the rest of the world will feel about us in that eventuality. Ultimately, today, Mr. Trump was not banned from entering the U.K., but the British parliament had a lively, healthy debate about it. And regardless of party affiliation, they did all seem to feel more or less the same way about our Republican presidential front-runner. And now I have to go look up the word wazzock. Wazzock. How do you spell it? That does it for us tonight. We`ll see you again tomorrow. Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL.” Good evening, Lawrence.  ']\n",
      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 15, 2016 Guest: Larry Paros ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Good evening, Chris. Have an excellent weekend, my friend. HAYES: You too. You too. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. Happy Friday. The numbers are in on the Republican debate last night. Turns out it was the least viewed Republican debate yet, which kind of surprises me. I mean, in the big picture there`s still nothing to complain about. The numbers are still giant, but fewer people watched last night`s Republican debate than any of the others this past year. The first one you`ll remember was giant 24 million viewers. The second one, 23 million viewers. The third one was 14 million. The fourth was 13 million. The fifth one went up a little bit. That was the Las Vegas one on CNN. That went up to 18 million viewers. Kind of looked like maybe viewership had gone down but it was coming back up. But, no, last night, it was back down to the lowest yet. It was 11 million people watching the main stage seven-kidnap Republican debate last night in South Carolina. And if you want to see how that stacks up against the Democratic debates, even with the Republican numbers dropping, the Republicans are still sitting pretty in terms of the size of the audiences they`re reaching. The Democrats of course this year have decided to hide their light under a Bushel. So, the Republicans have done six debates so far. The Republicans have only done three. The last two Democratic debates with viewership down there in the 8 million range, those were both held on weekend evenings. Not a great time to get big audiences. That scheduling plan is also true of the next Democratic debate, which will be this weekend on NBC, 9:00 on Sunday, on the Sunday of a three-day weekend. It`s kind of amazing. The Democratic Party has done everything it can to ensure the smallest possible audiences for their candidates` debates this year. But in terms of this next one, the race right now is so tight and it`s so increasingly snippy between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, I don`t think anybody really knows what kind of numbers they`re going to get on Sunday night. Sunday night of a holiday weekend is a weird time to do it. But with what`s going on in the race right now and the anticipation about Iowa and New Hampshire might be a bigger crowd than the Democrats are expecting. So, that`ll be one really interesting thing to see about Sunday. Here`s the truly amazing thing, though, about the Democrats` debate schedule. This Sunday night debate for the Democrats, this is it. They`re not holding any more Democratic debates before Iowa or before New Hampshire. Contrast that with the Republicans. The Republicans debated last night. That was their sixth debate. They`ve still got another one scheduled before Iowa. And then they`ve still got another one scheduled after that between Iowa and New Hampshire. But for the Democrats, no. It`s just this Sunday night of MLK Day weekend. And that`s it until mid February. It`s just amazing. But we`ve got these new viewership numbers today for the Republican debate last night. We also got some very intriguing news from the closed-door Republican Party winter meeting that they held at the site of their debate last night in South Carolina. Turns out at that meeting a member of the RNC, a man named Holland Redfield, great political name, Holland Redfield got up at that RNC meeting and made an impassioned speech to the rest of the National Republican Party and reportedly to Reince Priebus himself, the party chairman. He was apparently in the room when this happened. He was sort of the person to whom this speech was directed. But this RNC official, Holland Redfield, got up and in impromptu remarks said that the Republican presidential candidates this year were saying things on the debate stage and saying things in the media that, quote, “If your child was doing that you would put that child over your knee and spank them.” He lamented with a lot of passion how Republican candidates this year in his words were showing “disrespect for ethnic minorities and religious factions in the United States.” He said, quote, “We have to draw the line on that because sooner or later somebody has to pick up the pieces.” But then he closed with this very emotional plea, that this crop of Republican presidential candidates is basically destroying his Republican Party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOLLAND REDFIELD, GOP PARTY COMMITTEEMAN, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: A good politician is pragmatic. They have to be to succeed. Otherwise, you get this energy in the nation, right now, that is angry, frustrated, and they want to hit anybody. So, we have certain candidates that are sucking that up and changing our label. As a party, we owe it to ourselves to speak out and not have the tail wag the dog and not have somebody say all of a sudden, if you don`t play my game, then I`m running as an independent or I`m doing this. I`ll see and I`ll judge you. Good God, many of you have been in this room for year after year after year, working the trenches. And all of a sudden somebody`s going to tell you any one of them? This is our party. It`s the people`s party. Not the candidates. I`ve had it. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s a member of the Republican National Committee. He represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is an obscure part of the American polity, right? In terms of influence. But politico.com was sent that tape of him today from what was supposed to be a closed-door private meeting. And even though this is just one RNC committee man from the Virgin Islands, this tape of him making this impassioned plea about what happened to his party because of this presidential campaign, this got front-page play all day long at politico.com. It got huge attention in the beltway press today. And it`s interesting because it`s no secret that the Republican Party establishment is worried about Donald Trump, right? They`re worried about what Donald Trump is doing to the Republican Party as an constitution, what his front-running candidacy is doing to the whole idea of what it means to be a Republican. It`s one thing, though, to know that in the abstract. It`s another thing to see it, right? It`s another thing to know what that sounds like word for word behind closed doors when the Republican establishment thinks they`re alone trying to figure out how they`re going to do something about it. Just fascinating. That was kind of the front page of the beltway press today. The home town press, though, was probably even worse today for Chris Christie. Worse today for Chris Christie than I think it was for any of the other Republican presidential candidates who made it onto that main debate stage last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let`s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn`t support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Survey says? (BUZZER) Everybody gets fact checked after the debates. That`s one of the things we do in the political media now. Every newspaper does that, every wire does that. They run fact checks of how closely the candidates hue to the truth at big events like this and it has no impact whatsoever. But the Chris Christie fact checks from last night`s debate are so blunt and so outrageous that they`re actually – I think they`re actually funny. So, for example, Chris Christie said last night, let`s set the facts straight. First of all, I didn`t support Sonia Sotomayor. The “Star Ledger” in New Jersey gleefully posted Chris Christie`s official statement on Sonia Sotomayor from when she was nominated in 2009. Quote, “I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to confirm her nomination.” (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIE: I didn`t support Sonia Sotomayor. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. Yes, you did. And what was the other thing he wanted to get the facts straight on there? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIE: Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Again, back to the hometown press, back to the “Star Ledger” in New Jersey. They gleefully today go to their own archives from September 30th, 1994, which in a news article from that date quotes Chris Christie directly. “I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution.” (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIE: I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' I would say yes – you know, to be fair, “I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.” His personal contribution could have been not in the form of a check. He could have brought them a bucket full of nickels or something. Maybe it was cash. Maybe he gave them a gold Kruger and. I don`t know. Maybe it wasn`t a check and that`s what he means, even though he was previously directly quoted saying he gave them a personal contribution. In an editorial about this Planned Parenthood thing, an editorial the “Star-Ledger” titles “Another day, another lie,” Chris Christie`s hometown paper notes that if the governor is denying the accuracy of that direct quote he gave to that paper in 1994, saying he gave money to Planned Parenthood, if he`s now saying that quote is incorrect he can very easily take it up with the reporter who quoted him saying that back in the day because the reporter who wrote that article in 1994 and quoted Chris Christie directly where he said “I gave money to Planned Parenthood,” that reporter is now Chris Christie`s official spokesman in the New Jersey governor`s office. So, if he`s denying now all these years later that that quote was accurate, you can take it up with the guy who has to tell that to the press on the governor`s behalf. So, that`s awkward. And you know, every politician has trouble with the press to some degree from time to time. But Chris Christie`s dogged hometown press corps is just stuck to him like a rash. A few months ago it was the “Star Ledger” editorial board that said that Chris Christie, quote, “lies like the rest of us brush our teeth, as a matter of routine.” No matter how well Chris Christie does in his presidential campaign, no matter how many main stages he makes of the debates now, honestly, his hometown press is never going to let go of him. But the worst press of the day actually happened to old Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush I think had really wanted and expected this to be a good news day for him. It started off with Lindsey Graham endorsing him in South Carolina. They did an event together. They even shared a funny joke about people who do not eat meat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: The thing I like most about Jeb is he`s not overselling. He`s embracing the fact that we`re a diverse country, we have to sit down and work with Democrats and independents, libertarians, and vegetarians, to get immigration right – JEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have to work with vegetarians? GRAHAM: Yes, you do. There are not many in South Carolina but we`re going to win the vegetarian vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' It`s funny, right? All started great for Jeb Bush today. If they kept that patter going, they probably would have gotten around to a hilarious joke about Bill Clinton being a vegan or something. Like you see where this is going. This is good post-debate momentum. But instead what broke is this story, also at politico.com, which is just devastating for Jeb Bush. Look at the headline. “Bush donors await green light to jump ship.” And that is a terrible headline not just because it`s a mixed metaphor. Is the bear Catholic? The reason this is terrible is because “Politico” got blind quotes from members of the Republican donor class who for some reason are willing to tell reporters what they really think about Jeb Bush even though at least nominally they are still supporting him and giving him money. Quote, “Politico talked to nearly two dozen major donors. Most say they are waiting for what veteran Republican described as the family hall pass to jump to another campaign after the New Hampshire primary.” One top Bush Wall Street donor tells “Politico,” quote, “I`m resigned to it being over, frankly. It`s really disappointing. I`d urge him to get out after New Hampshire if he doesn`t do well, but he probably won`t.” Just think about – if these folks really are Bush supporters, Bush donors, why do they talk to the press about him this way? The worst things that have been said about Jeb Bush in the press this year have been said by people who are supposedly supporting him. And then the next quote they`ve got, and this is even worse. This is a direct quote. A Bush fund-raiser has told donors recently, quote, “Hey, I need you to throw away money on Jeb out of loyalty.” The only – if that`s what`s being said, the only people who presumably heard that said were either the fund-raiser who said it or the donors to whom the fund-raiser was talking. These are all high-level Jeb Bush supporters, but they`re willing to give a deadly quote like that to the press about Jeb. With friends like these, who needs far more skilled and attractive competitors? “The Washington Post`s” Robert Costa has been reporting today and tonight on the dawning realization in Republican circles that none of the establishment candidates might make it and it really might be Donald Trump or even Ted Cruz as the party`s nominee. Joining us now is Robert Costa from “The Washington Post.” He`s also an MSNBC contributor. Robert, I know your piece on this just posted within the last hour at “The Post”. Thanks very much for joining us. I know you`re busy. ROBERT COSTA, THE WASHINGTON POST: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, your lead is as the presidential primary moves into a more urgent and combative phase, there is growing acceptance among Republicans, including the Washington and financial elite that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are the two most likely to become the party`s nominee. What are the signs of that growing acceptance? What does that mean? COSTA: Some stunning signs tonight. My colleague Phil Rucker and I were calling around the Republican establishment to top donors in the party and post this last debate we said, where is the donor class moving? And they said there`s a new realization within this group, the billionaires and the millionaires that have funded the party for decades, that is in essence a two-person race, Trump versus Cruz, and there`s an inclination now that Trump could be the nominee, and there are people right now reaching out to Trump to try to get meetings, to try to get in his inner circle and that was said on the record by Romney`s former finance chairman. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the implication there is that establishment donors, establishment sort of big ticket Republicans in looking at Trump versus Cruz, they`re going to side with Trump? COSTA: There`s an inclination toward Trump over Cruz. And not so much because they know Trump well but it seems to be more of their ilk. He`s someone who has a lot of friends on Wall Street. Cruz does as well, but Cruz is a hard-liner. He`s ideological. The GOP donor class is not so much driven by ideology but by power. ', 'MADDOW:', ' One of the complications here, at least in terms of understanding this as normal politics or something we might be able to extrapolate from past experience, is that Mr. Trump is not really accepting donations. I mean, there are small dollar donation that`s are being made to him but the way that big ticket Republican donors are used to being courted and used to having influence and used to making their decisions is who`s going to take their money and what kind of access that`s going to give them. If Donald Trump is going to continue to not take a lot of money, then what sort of dynamic is going to exist between him and this donor class? COSTA: That`s the central important question. Donors right now in the Republican Party are recalibrating how they think through their relationships with candidates. They know Trump doesn`t want to accept major checks in the primary race. So, they`re thinking ahead to a possible general election. And the way they gamed it out to “The Washington Post” tonight, they said we`ll have to donate to the party committee, we`ll have to prove if Trump`s the nominee that we`re supporting him by supporting the RNC and different Senate and House committees. They`re just rethinking the whole way they would handle a general election to try to make sure the nominee, should it be Trump, liked them and would perhaps bring them in should there be a new Republican administration. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Robert, from the conversations you and Phillip are having with these folks, is it a dead end for Ted Cruz? Are these – I think it may be frustrating for those donors as they try to approach Trump if Trump hues to his plan that he`s been on thus far. Does Ted Cruz really have nowhere to go with them? COSTA: No, I wouldn`t say that at all because while there is a consensus this is becoming a two-man race among the donors, the top donors in the party, there`s also a lot of hesitation still about Trump. People are covering their bets. They`re getting ready for Trump should he be the nominee. At the same time, Cruz is a Texas senator. He`s someone who`s part of an institution, even if he`s not popular there, and he makes a lot of people - - some people more comfortable in the donor class. So, there is a split between Trump and Cruz. It seems to be a little more leaning toward Trump because he`s not ideological and a hard-liner. ', 'MADDOW:', ' This is an amazing turn of events. It seems weird as an observer. But if you`re a Republican establishment figure used to the way Republican politics goes, this must be a total acid trip. Robert Costa from “The Washington Post”, MSNBC contributor. Robert, thanks. Fascinating reporting. Thank you. COSTA: Thank you. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I will say going back to the vegetarian theme of the Jeb Bush/Lindsey Graham joke will this really is like there`s some sort of vegan convention, right? There`s some sort of vegetarian convention and they`ve decided the choice they`re going to give people for dinner is two different varieties of barbecue. It`s like do you want ribs or do you want brisket? And people are just like no, but I`m hungry. The Republican donor class deciding to treat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Correction. On the show last night I said something wrong. Last night on the show, I said that in the Democratic presidential debate that`s happening this Sunday on NBC, Chuck Todd and Andrea Mitchell would be helping to ask questions. That`s what I thought was happening. But I was wrong. And so I said it wrong on TV and I`m sorry. What is going to happen is that, as I explained, Lester Holt is going to be the moderator of the debate – Lester Holt from NBC “Nightly News.” It is Andrea Mitchell who will be helping ask questions. What Chuck Todd is actually going to be doing is hosting the pregame right here on MSNBC. So, the pregame for the debate is at 8:00 here on MSNBC with Chuck Todd. The debate is at 9:00 on NBC, Lester Holt with Andrea Mitchell contributing some questions. It`s going to be great. I`m sorry I was confusing. We will see you there Sunday night. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, there have been a few stories over the years that we have zeroed in on on this show before anybody else in the national media really focused on them. Stories that ended up ultimately becoming really big important national consequence stories. One of them was the Chris Christie bridge scandal. There were great New Jersey reporters covering that story but we were the first national press to give it any sustained attention before that story blew up nationally the way it did. I think the Flint water story sadly is another one. Great local reporting by Michigan Public Radio and the “Flint Journal” and the “Detroit Free Press” and other local publications. Great activism locally. But we were the first national press to give it sustained attention before that story blew up the way it`s still blowing up nationally right now. But there is another one of these kinds of stories, another one that we were basically first to in the national press. We covered the heck out of for months, which is now coming back. It`s the story of Virginia`s Republican governor Bob McDonnell. His multiple felony corruption charges. That story appeared to be over. Once the good governor got convicted on multiple felonies and sentenced to years in federal prison, it felt like it was over. Then it really felt like it was over when he lost his appeals. But now, all of a sudden, it`s back. And it`s back in a way that could potentially bring a lot of other public corruption cases back from the dead with it. It`s a fairly shocking turn of events here. It broke late today. And that story`s next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' March 2013, “Washington Post” ran a strange article about who had really paid for the wedding of the governor of Virginia`s daughter. The governor said that he had paid for the wedding, but it turns out he didn`t. It turns out a businessman paid for it and the businessman who paid for the wedding also had showered Governor McDonnell and his family with hundreds of thousands of dollars of gifts and loans and vacations and golf games and white Ferrari the government got to drive for a while and all the rest of it. It all came out. In 2014, Governor McDonnell and his wife were all convict on multiple felony corruption charges, not just for taking those gifts but because federal prosecutors proved in court that in exchange for those gifts the governor helped the businessman out. He arranged meetings for him with state officials, he let him host events at the governor`s mansion, he even pushed the businessman`s request that the guy`s dietary supplement should be studied by Virginia`s public university researchers. He was convicted, sentenced to prison. Well, now, today, a year and a half after that conviction and almost a year exactly since the governor was sentenced to years of federal prison time, today, the United States Supreme Court said they`re going to hear Bob McDonnell`s case. The Supreme Court is taking this back up. Whoo! What does this mean? Joining us now is Ari Melber, MSNBC`s chief legal correspondent. Ari, that`s my very erudite way of expressing the key question here. What does this mean? ARI MELBER, MSNBC CHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: What it means anytime the Supreme Court grants search to review a case is at least four members think something is up, something that`s worth their very limited time and valuable attention. Either they want to consider overturning this conviction or they think it raises important broader issues that they want to deal with. ', 'MADDOW:', ' And the broader issues would be that they don`t like the federal statutes that resulted in the conviction, that there`s something wrong with the law? MELBER: Something that is in their view either wrong with the law or that prosecutors have done to stretch the law. As you know, this big issue in this case is what is an official act, right? What does it mean if the governor takes money and then goes to do something about it? What does it mean if he does something that is official using his power versus whatever else might be a part of his job or unimportant part? So, there may be a concern here that this Supreme Court, which we know is skeptical of what we might call regulating politics, that it`s concerned that the prosecutorial theory here that what basically the federal government did was expand the notion of what unofficial acts are, which might make it easier for them to convict people who take bribes, gifts, money, whatever, and try to do things with it. ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, the appeal – the case on appeal from Bob McDonnell`s lawyers has been, listen, he took these gifts and you may think it`s ugly and he may be really tacky, but it`s not illegal under Virginia law or federal law for him to take these things, what`s illegal is for him to do stuff in his official capacity as governor in exchange for them, it`s the quid pro quo. And what they`re saying is what he did was just normal political stuff he would have done for anybody, when you arrange a meeting for somebody, that`s not an act, that`s just a thing you do that doesn`t depend on you being governor, I guess? MELBER: Yes. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Is this a theory that people push broadly because they don`t like public corruption prosecutions or is this going to be a Bob McDonnell- specific ruling? MELBER: That`s a great question. I think it can be broader. I mean, there aren`t many states where you can just take this much in gifts and not be in trouble under state law to begin with. So, it`s not going to necessarily hit everywhere. But the idea here, Rachel, is essentially maybe we were a little corrupt and a little briby but we weren`t very effective, so don`t worry about it because the only thing we did was we did a photo op or we had a meeting. No one, for example, contests that a staffer did go to a meeting. What they`re saying is, hey, that doesn`t rise all the way to the level of pulling this off. Of course, the government is responding here going all the way up to the Supreme Court. So, it`s the Obama administration`s lawyer is responding saying no, this was an official attempt to help the person bribing you. How effective your attempts were aren`t the test. The test – ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, if you were bad at paying somebody the quo in the quid pro quo doesn`t mean you weren`t engaged in a bribery transaction. MELBER: Exactly. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Fascinating. Ari Melber, MSNBC chief legal correspondent – when this goes further along and they`re going to hear this case and rule on it eventually we`re going to have you back to explain that too. MELBER: I would love to. I think the oral arguments are going to be fascinating. ', 'MADDOW:', ' I wonder if they`ll let me in. Much more to come this busy Friday night. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Learning new details tonight about that horrible accident involving two U.S. Marine Corps helicopters which collided in mid-air apparently off the coast of Hawaii today. We do get news about training accidents from time to time in the U.S. military. This one stands out specifically because the human toll in this one may be really high. It was 12 U.S. Marines who were on board these two heavy lift cargo helicopters. They`re CH-53 helicopters. They`re usually called Sea Stallions. They`re really big. They`re really powerful. These two aircraft took off from the local marine corps base sometime last night. Officials say the Marines were on a routine nighttime training mission. But at around 11:30 p.m. last night local time in Hawaii, Coast Guard says they were contacted by someone who had been walking on the beach. That person reported seeing a fireball in the air. Minutes later, the Coast Guard says they got another call, this one from somebody reporting a flare in the sky. Officials now believe that what those two separate witnesses saw was a helicopter accident, what appears to have been a collision between the two choppers. Tonight, a search and rescue operation is still under way. The Coast Guard is leading this effort. They`re getting help from local authorities. The Navy has dispatched two destroyers to help search for any survivors. The search area is really big. And it`s about seven miles offshore. The whole area they`re searching stretches about 20 miles. Officials say debris has been found across that entire area. The weather has also been making the search difficult. They say it`s very choppy waters. There are waves in that area as high as 40 feet. Very bad news is that as of tonight, none of the marines on board those two helicopters have been found. Officials say the search efforts could last for several more days. But this is 12 U.S. Marines we`re talking about. It`s just terrible news so far. We`ll keep you posted if and when we learn more. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What is your view of what`s wrong there? If you were president now, would you do something in terms of the response that isn`t already being done? HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right now, as best I can understand, the governor, the Republican governor, Governor Snyder, is refusing to ask for the triggering of the federal help that he needs in order to take care of the people who are his constituents. I am just outraged by this. I would pull out every stop. And I think I would look for any provision in the law that would permit me to override the lack of request from the governor if he refuses to still ask for what I think his people deserve to have. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on this show last night, saying if she were president, she`d be doing everything in her power to help Flint, Michigan, with its lead-poisoned water crisis. Within two hours of her saying that, Governor Rick Snyder officially asked the federal government for help in Flint. He is now asking President Obama for both an emergency declaration and a major disaster declaration for Flint. He`s now requesting nearly $100 million in federal help, both for water distribution and for repairing Flint`s ruined water pipes. According to the governor`s office, quote, “The expense of replacing infrastructure and keeping the community supplied with safe drinking water is more than the state can bear.” FEMA is going to make a recommendation on this request to President Obama, and then President Obama will decide what aid to provide. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today that this decision about Flint from the federal government could come as early as this weekend and none too soon. That said, it does remain to be seen how much help the federal government will provide for a disaster that was manmade, that the state, the Snyder administration inflicted on its own city. But again, that federal decision could come as soon as this weekend. Signs indicate that it probably will. So watch for that over the course of the weekend. We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' This was a Republican presidential candidates events this past November. Fair warning here. This is a little bit intense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PASTOR KEVIN SWANSON: There are families whose – we`re talking Christian families, pastors` families, elders` families, and good godly churches. Their sons are rebelling, hanging out with homosexuals and getting married. And the parents are invited. What would you do if that was the case? Here`s what I would do. Sack cloth and ashes at the entrance to the church. And I`d sit in cow manure and I`d spread it all over my body. That`s what I would do. And I`m not kidding. I`m not laughing. I`m grieving! I`m mourning! I`m pointing out the problem! It`s not a gay time! These are the people with the sores, the gaping sores. The sores that are pussy and gross and people are coming in and carving happy faces on the sores. That`s not a nice thing to do. Don`t you dare carve happy faces on open pussy sores. Don`t you ever do that. Don`t you ever do that. I tell you don`t do it. Sack cloth and ashes. This is what America needs. America needs to hear the message. We are messed up. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oh, yes, we are. That was Pastor Kevin Swanson at a religious liberties conference that he hosted in November in Des Moines, Iowa. The pretty major theme of that event, both in terms of literature that was available at the event and the way the host of the conference spoke from the stage of that conference, pretty major theme was the issue of basically the practical challenges and the timing of how exactly and when exactly the United States should start rounding up gay people in this country in order to execute them, because according to this pastor, it`s really just a matter of implementation and timing. He says it is absolutely settled as a moral matter and a judicial matter that the appropriate punishment for the crime of being gay ought to be that the government should have you killed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SWANSON: This is the highest level, the very highest level of clarity where the word of god has spoken, both Old Testament and New Testament, ought not to be any debate whatsoever about it. And you know what that sin is. It`s the sin of homosexuality. Romans 1, First Corinthians Chapter 6, First Timothy I think it`s Chapter 4. And, of course, Leviticus 18 and Leviticus 20. The word of God speaks there both – in fact Romans Chapter 1, Paul affirms that this particular sin is worthy of death, in Romans Chapter 1. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' What made that event more than just interesting, what made it politically important on a national scale is that at that event Pastor Kevin Swanson, that guy, was issuing his call for the death penalty for homosexuality in America from the same stage where he welcomed not one, not two, but three Republican candidates for president of the United States. Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, and Mike Huckabee all came to that event and shook the hand of the “kill the gays” guy. Shared the stage with him and took questions from him. When we asked those three candidates about sharing the stage with this pastor who on that stage at that same event explicitly called for the death penalty for gay people, we heard back only from the Ted Cruz campaign, which sent us this amazing two-word response. They sent us this, quote, “not explicit.” As in we did not think Pastor Swanson`s repeated calls to kill gay people were explicit enough to require any sort of explanation from us about why Ted Cruz was comfortable doing this guy`s event. Of those three Republican presidential candidates who shared the stage with Kevin Swanson, two of them are still in the presidential race now. Bobby Jindal`s out. But Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee are still in. And they are both headed to another charming shindig this weekend. And this time they`ll have even more company. People for the American Way now reports that even more Republican presidential candidates, we think as many as seven, are going to be joining an event this weekend hosted by this guy. (BGIN VIDEO CLIP) PASTOR RICK SCARBOROUGH: The reason Satan`s trying to destroy this country right now is because we send more missionaries, do more good than any nation in history. But that`s all at stake right now because they`ve now by the act of five unelected judges, mandated something upon this country that for the first time can kill it! Abortion is a horrible thing. But you and I can opt out of abortion. We just don`t have them. If we have them, we then ask God to forgive us and those babies that have been slain are deposited in heaven for the next life. But when homosexuals begin lining up to adopt those children, they will – they will literally disciple them into an early grave called hell! (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That charming man is Pastor Rick Scarborough. This is the guy who seven Republican presidential candidates have decided to share their weekend with this weekend. The Family Research Council says they`re going to appear in a special broadcast with the guy who says he is so opposed to homosexuality that he once said he was ready to burn to death rather than accept gay marriage as legal. After the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, some media outlets contacted Pastor Rick Scarborough to see if he was going to self-immolate because of the ruling. Pastor Rick was forced to clarify he would not actually be setting himself on fire despite his earlier promises. But where Pastor Rick Scarborough really stands out is in his continued propagation of a theory that AIDS is a disease sent by God to punish gay people. Which at this point is kind of an old-fashioned assertion, right, even for the religious right. Rick Scarborough is so old-fashioned about this he even still refers to AIDS by one name that was used for a hot second in the early `80s – GRID. Remember that? It meant gay related immune deficiency. That misnomer really only existed for a little while in the early `80s before they figured out what AIDS and later HIV actually were. But Pastor Scarborough still use that`s term. Except he gets it wrong and he calls it GRIDs instead of GRID. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCARBOROUGH: I believe that GRIDs was God`s judgment on a sinful generation. I mean, I don`t apologize for that. Is it an unforgivable sin? Of course not. In fact, I believe God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today if we put our foot down and said we no longer tolerate this, we`re not going to fund it with health care, we`re going to hold you accountable. I believe when we start repenting across this country, some sharp probably Christian or Jewish researcher would find the AIDS cure. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' See, if we would just hold the gays accountable by refusing to give them health care for their gay disease, then God would just give the cure for AIDS to some researchers. But only a Christian or Jewish researcher because I mean, God has standards, right? According to Pastor Rick Scarborough, God has visited many horrors on this country because of our immoral ways. He said the Aurora movie theater massacre in college happened because god lowered his protection because of the number of children born without of wedlock in this country and the fact abortion is legal. Also, Benghazi also turns out not Hillary Clinton`s fault. Or only partly her fault. Pastor Scarborough says God allowed the Benghazi attack because, quote, “America is mired in sin.” So mired are we in sin in fact that god might just nuke us all into oblivion any day now and he would be justified to do it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCARBOROUGH: We may not conceive America – every day I`m amazed that we live another day, that God gives us grace. This thing could all come crashing down either economically or with a series of dirty bombs going off in our major cities or one major nuclear bomb that would destroy half the country and contaminate the rest. And if that happens, God is perfectly just and vindicated, because we have squandered our grace in this country. (END VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, this weekend, that guy, Pastor Rick Scarborough, is hosting a political event with these candidates. Again, at least that`s proclaimed by the Family Research Council in their press release about the event. They say they`re expecting Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio and Rick Santorum. I should note the Family Research Council also said they were expecting Donald Trump to participate in this thing, but the Trump campaign told us tonight they are not. So, maybe it`s all a bluff. Maybe none of these candidates will show up. But we have asked them all. The Family Research Council says all these candidates will be guest of Pastor Rick Scarborough this weekend. A live broadcast that will be beamed into conservative churches around the country, all these candidates along with their friends, Mr. AIDS is a gay plague sent by an angry God. We reached out to all the candidates` campaigns for comment on this event, we`ll let you know if we hear back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ', 'MADDOW:', ' Hey. Hey, what is that? It`s Friday Night News Dump. Nick Tuths, who`s tonight`s lucky player? NICK TUTHS, TRMS PRODUCER: Tonight, we`ve got Larry Paros. He`s from Kirkland, Washington. He`s 81 years old. He`s a teacher and education innovator and he writes about language and politics. Rachel, meet Larry. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Mr. Paros, Larry, welcome. It`s nice to meet you.

I`ve only just met you now, but I can tell you`re already becoming a favorite of mine as well. I think this is going to go great. PAROS: Love it. ', 'MADDOW:', ' It`s a pretty simple game, as you know. You`re going to get three questions. If you get at least two of them right, you will win a small piece of junk that Nick will show you. It`s a teeny tiny cocktail shaker. We`re not very proud of this, but we will send it to you. We also have a bonus prize this week which is something random that we found in our office. It`s more random than usual. Nick will tell us what it is. TUTHS: This right here is a “for sale Barack Obama`s Senate seat call Rob Blagojevich” t-shirt.

PAROS: Just what I need. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Perfect. All right, Larry. We also need to bring in the disembodied voice of Steve Benen from Maddow Blog. He`ll determine whether or not you got the right answer in tonight`s question. Steve, meet Larry. Larry, meet Steve. STEVE BENEN, MADDOW BLOG: Good evening to you both. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. PAROS: Hi, disembodied voice. ', 'MADDOW:', ' All right. Here we go, Larry, first question is from Monday`s show. On Monday show, we reported that Michigan`s largest newspaper, which had twice endorsed Rick Snyder for governor had nevertheless just run a blistering editorial criticizing Governor Rick Snyder for his handling of the led poisoning in the city of Flint. What was the very provocative title of that “Detroit Free Press” editorial? Was it A, “Snyder to city: Drop dead”; B, “Yes, Virginia, there is a water crisis”; C, “Heck of a job, Governor”, or D, “Lansing, we`ve got a problem”? PAROS: Well, I think it`s shades of Brownie, so I`ll go with C, “Heck of a job, Governor”. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Steve, did Larry get that right? BENEN: Let`s check Monday`s show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ', 'MADDOW:', ' That same editorial board endorsed Snyder for governor. Now, they`re calling his actions, shameful and maddening. They castigating him for heaping misery on the people to Flint. They`re entitled their op-ed, “Heck of a job, Governor.” (END VIDEO CLIP) BENEN: Heck of a job, Larry. The correct answer is C. Larry is one for one. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Except, when you did a heck of a job, it didn`t have that – it doesn`t have the other entendre. You actually – anyway, you know what I mean. OK. Second one is from Wednesday show. On Wednesday show, we reported on the release of one of the more effective Republican political ads of this whole presidential cycle. At least I thought that was one of the best ones I`ve seen this year. The ad features a reality show star who has become a very influential figure in conservative politics. Who is that TV star and which candidate is that star endorsing in the ad? Is it, A, Snooki for “The Jersey Shore” endorsing Chris Christie? Is it, B, Phil Robertson from “Duck Dynasty” endorsing Ted Cruz? Is it C, Bristol Palin from “Dancing with the Stars” endorsing Carly Fiorina? Or is it D, Donald Trump from “The Apprentice” endorsing Donald Trump? PAROS: Well, let`s go with a little bit of quackery and go with B. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Steve, B is Larry`s guess. What`s the right answer? BENEN: Let`s check Wednesday`s segment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL ROBERTSON, DUCK DYNASTY: He`s godly. He loves us, he`s the man for the job and he will go duck hunting, because today we`re going. Ted Cruz is my man. I`m voting for him. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BENEN: Yes. The correct answer is B, and Larry is right again. ', 'MADDOW:', ' Larry, well done. One more question for you. PAROS: OK. ', 'MADDOW:', ' This is from last night`s show. And last night`s show was a little different than most night`s shows. I have this long interview with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. One of the things I asked her about was whether gender politics would be a major consideration for her if she gets a chance to pick a vice presidential running mate? Secretary Clinton answered that she would be happy picking a woman or a man for the job if she gets to pick a running mate. She also then floated one celebrity possibility. Which celebrity did Secretary Clinton bring up in that discussion on who she might pick as a running mate? Was it A, Phil Robertson of “Duck Dynasty”, B, Beyonce, c, Oprah Winfrey, or D, Leonardo DiCaprio? PAROS: I – seeing that he`s the hottest thing going right now, let`s go with D, Leonardo DiCaprio.

I think what is – ', 'MADDOW:', ' You have to ask the bear. CLINTON: Yes, ask the bear. (END VIDEO CLIP) BENEN: Yes, the correct answer is Leonardo DiCaprio and Larry is right once again.

      "['Transcript: Show: THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW Date: January 14, 2016 Guest: Hillary Clinton  ', 'RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST:', ' Thanks for being with us tonight.  Usually this is the time in the show where I`m about to start talking for an uninterrupted 17 minutes that involves a lot of really arcane historical illusions. Tonight something different, because you`ve been very good. Tonight, we`re joined by a special guest, who is hard to get. She was here in the building to do “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon. And we asked if she could swing by, it turns out she could.  So, joining us now for the interview is Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.  Secretary Clinton, thank you.  HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Excellent, I thought I would come during historical illusion time.  (LAUGHTER)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, like we`ve heard enough about 1952, Maddow, let`s go further back. Very good.  Well, let me ask you, start with something very much in the headlines right now, and interestingly, it was in the headlines during President Obama`s State of the Union. That was the situation with these sailors who were taken by Iran.  CLINTON: Right, right.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Obviously released yesterday, in part because we have more open lines of diplomatic communication with Iran, which is a good thing. What`s your reaction, though, to Iran videotaping these Americans as prisoners, broadcasting their surrender on their boats, what appeared to be an out-of-context apology. Was that upsetting? Should there be consequences for that?  CLINTON: Well, of course, it was upsetting to me. I think that the American sailors and up the command chain made it clear it looked like there was a mistake, you know, we were inadvertently in their territorial waters.  OK. Fine. Let`s recognize it and let`s move on. Don`t try to turn it into some political propaganda coup, because it isn`t and shouldn`t be. And it raises the kind of challenges we`re going to have going forward with Iran, because after all, I support it, I helped start the process that led to the agreement on the nuclear weapons. And we have to enforce that agreement vigorously. If there are any slips or misses on the parts of the Iranians, there have to be consequences.  But we have this whole other arena of problems we have to deal with when it comes to Iran.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Nonnuclear issues.  CLINTON: Nonnuclear issues. In fact, one of the best arguments for the nuclear agreement was let`s put a lid on their nuclear weapons program, it would give us time and breathing space to deal with a lot of the aggressiveness, the undermining of governments, continuing outrageous support of Assad as he murders his people day after day.  So, it wasn`t clear to me, but if I were guessing, you`re right, good that we have an open channel. Because when I was there we had very little opportunity to communicate. It was complicated. We would often have to go through other countries to get a message –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' As intermediaries.  CLINTON: Intermediaries, right. So, that`s the good side.  The not-so-good side is, if you`re going to be a mature country and you`re going to shoulder responsibilities, which you leaders claim you are ready to do, act like it. So –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' In terms of pressing Iran for consequences on that, what would you do?  CLINTON: I think on this one, I would put them on notice that, just as we`ve said and I have given a lot of remarks about this, we`re going to enforce the nuclear agreement very vigilantly, we`re also going to be looking – if they want to play a game where they turn something that was accidental into an international case, well, they`re going to have to take the consequences if we do the same.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I want to ask you about the presidential race right now. New Iowa polling out in – today from “The Des Moines Register”, the race is tightening in Iowa. You always said you expected that it would tighten at this point in the race.  CLINTON: Right, right.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' But “The Des Moines Register” had this write-up when they put out the poll explaining basically what`s going on. At least the way they read it, they say that Senator Sanders is basically doing better than you with the same groups that powered President Obama`s victory in Iowa in 2008, namely young people, first-time caucus-goers and independents.  So, if Iowa this year against Bernie Sanders looks a bit like Iowa in 2008 against Barack Obama, don`t you need to change what you`re doing to try to crack the code with those kinds of voters?  CLINTON: Well, I don`t think so and here`s why. I have a much better organization than I did back in `08. I have an organization that is a great mixture of people who worked for President Obama in `08 and 2012, people worked for me, people new to the process.  I`ve got a lot of confidence in them, what they`re doing, and we have a very significant core of committed supporters. That`s what the caucus really eventually ends up counting. Who will come out on February 1st? It`s cold in Iowa right now. We`re all a bit chilled, and actually be there for whatever amount of time it takes.  I feel very good. Now, that doesn`t mean I`m not going to work like crazy to reach as many as I possibly can, because that`s what I`m doing, that`s what I will be doing. And, of course, I want to reach groups of people that, you know, are still making up their minds or may think they have made up their minds but are still persuadable.  So, between now and when the doors open on February 1st at 6:30, we`re going to do everybody we can to add to the numbers of people who have committed to caucus for me.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' The character of the campaign, the tone of the campaign, the way you`re trying to persuade those undecided voters seems to have changed a bit in the last week or so. Just this afternoon, your campaign in my estimation set its hair on fire a little bit when you guys convened this press call to discuss what you called Senator Sanders` attack ad against you. Your campaign said it was – he was the first candidate to go negative in this campaign.  I have seen the ad that you`re referring to. Honestly, it is not much of an attack. It never says your name. It says there`s two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street, his, and one that says, I`m going to quote it directly – “It`s OK to take millions from big banks and then tell them what to do.”  So, yes, that`s an oblique criticism of you taking Wall Street donations, but it`s not like something new. It`s not something over the top that means that he`s now this personal attacker in the campaign.  CLINTON: Well, let`s put it into the broader context. Obviously, Senator Sanders has said repeatedly he doesn`t do that, he doesn`t, you know, engage in negative attacks, and I take him at his word, on anything personal. We don`t do that in our side of the debate, you know?  We engage on substantive differences. We have some. He`s been pointing out what he believes to be differences for quite some time from his point of view.  So, I have been pointing out what differences are, because I think the voters expect us to have something of a spirited debate and to let them know where we stand on health care, on guns, on the economy and all the rest of the really important question that voters are asking about this election.  So, what I think people reacted to is that it was a very broad assertion that caught up all Democrats. I mean, basically, it`s also a very direct criticism of President Obama, who you may recall took a lot of funding from the financial industry when he ran in 2008. That didn`t stop him for fighting for the hardest regulations on Wall Street since the Great Depression, signing Dodd/Frank, getting everything he could get out of the Congress at the time.  So, there is a difference. I think that, you know, the president and many Democrats who support Dodd/Frank, we are fighting to prevent it from being turned back and eviscerated by the Republicans, you know, are saying, wait a minute, this is hard work. And what the president got done and what the Democrats who stood with him got done is a pretty important accomplishment if we`re going to rein in the excesses on Wall Street.  So, it`s a funny kind of charge. It`s sort of a pox on all your houses for all the Democrats, and I think that`s what raised some eyebrows.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' The way you have rebutted that, particular your campaign has rebutted that, is about Senator Sanders and the way he`s campaigning. I mean, you are saying he`s the first candidate to go negative, calling that an attack ad. Recently, your campaign has said, quote, “He can`t level with the American people. He`s not done what he has promised, shifting answers.”  Senator Sanders, obviously, is your opponent. Nobody expects you guys to walk hand in hand and come to consensus who ought to be nominee. But he also doesn`t have an enemy in the world in the Democratic Party, and he doesn`t have an enemy in the world in his home state. People say in Vermont, Donald Trump rally, I`m considering voting for Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, it`s because his appeal is so strong that he`s even appealing to the Trump voters up there. He`s a very well-respected figure.  Your campaign is essentially fighting in millennium with a way that is casting aspersions on his character, calling him dishonest.  CLINTON: No, no, I can`t –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' He won`t level with the American people?  CLINTON: Let`s parse this out. First of all, I`m very proud to have the support of the present governor of Vermont, two former governors of Vermont, including Howard Dean. I`m very honored to have the support of the other senator, Patrick Leahy.  So, people who are from that same state have concluded that they want to see me become the Democratic nominee and, in fact, are working hard to make that happen. I have no – I have nothing but good things to say about Senator Sanders either personally, and I admire his incredible advocacy for the positions he holds.  But the specific question that was raised here has to do with health care and taxes, because I`ve been laying out my plans, Rachel. I`ve been telling you where I`m going to get the money, I`ve been telling how much it`s going to cost, what I will do, and for months, his campaign has been saying before the Iowa caucus, we will tell you what we are proposing in taxes and the bulk of what he is advocating for is a single-payer health care system which would probably cost about $15 trillion.  So, the voters have been led to believe that before they go make their decision, they`ll be able to compare what I want to do to get to universal care, which is to defend, support and enhance the Affordable Care Act, and what Senator Sanders has said he wants to do, which is to basically start all over again, start a contentious debate, try to get to a single-payer system, but he`s not telling us what it will look like and cost.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Do you disagree with that goal? Do you agree with single payer as a good – you just think it would be too hard to do?  CLINTON: No, I agree with universal health care.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' No matter how you get there?  CLINTON: No matter how you get there, but to me Affordable Care Act is one of the signature accomplishments not of this president, but of the Democratic Party. We`ve been trying to get something like this done since Harry Truman.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right.  CLINTON: I worked really hard on that in `93 and `94, and I was thrilled when the president signed the Affordable Care Act.  Now, I expect the Republicans to do what they`re trying to do, repeal it, they did it last week. Thankfully, the president could veto it.  But I`m a little surprised to be having this debate and it`s really a very general debate when it comes to Senator Sanders about, no, we need to have a single-payer system. Well, what does that mean?  Now, the only clue that I can find because he hasn`t laid out a plan is to go back and look at the bills that he`s introduced nine different times and it`s a bit concerning to me, because it would basically end all the kind of health care we know, Medicare, Medicaid, the CHIP program, children`s health insurance, Tri-Care for the National Guard, Military, Affordable Care Act exchange policies, employer-based policies. He would take all that and hand it over to the states. And –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, he calls it Medicare for all. He`s basically would say we replace –  (CROSSTALK)  CLINTON: But Medicare for all is not the same if you`re turning it over to the states.  Now, if he has changed his mind after introducing the bill nine times, he owes it to the public to tell them. If he has changed his mind about having the federal government pay 86 percent of the cost and having states have to come up with the remaining 14 percent, when in fact we know Republican governors won`t even pay for Medicaid, which they are going to get initially for nothing – well, that`s what we need.  Now, we`ve been rolling out our plans and policies on the assumption that when we get toward the end, when people are really paying attention, they`re going to say, OK, I`ve got to compare this and contrast it, what`s their position on guns, what`s their position on health care?  And it`s a little bit concern that – you know, the devil`s in the details when it comes to health care. I am both passion and somewhat informed about how this is.  So, if you`re going to say free health care, Medicare for all, you owe it to voters to say, this is what it will cost and you will have to contribute x from your payroll tax. X from the income tax and if we`re still going to hand it over to the states, the states are going to come up with money from somewhere, and you`re going to have to kind of figure out how you work with the governor of this state.  So, that`s not Medicare for all. Medicare for all is a very different model. And – so I`m just saying that we`re only engaging in substantive differences. And I think that`s what you`re supposed to do when you`re in a contest as important as this one. What`s your policy? What`s my policy? How do you defend it? How do you explain it? And then we let the voters make up their minds.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Let me ask you about a different kind of health issue. You`ve put out statements on the lead poisoning crisis situation in Flint, Michigan, which we`ve covered a lot.  CLINTON: Yes.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I know you sent a couple of staffers yesterday to meet with the mayor in Flint.  CLINTON: Yes.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' What is your view of what`s wrong there? If you were president now, would you do something in terms of the response that isn`t already being done?  CLINTON: Well, I`m very pleased that FEMA is trying to do what it can there. In speaking with the congressional delegation, Senator Stabenow, Congressman Kildee and others, they`re trying figure out how they`re going to get enough funding so that kids can be tested, adults too, but let`s focus on the kids because that`s where the real damage is. This is infuriating to me. I did a lot of work on trying to get rid of lead in residential housing in Upstate New York. I care deeply about this issue. We know it has an affects on behavior and educational attainment.  So, we need to test kids. We need to provide quickly whatever health care they can get, whatever antidote is possible, and we need a fund for education, because some of these kids, if they`ve been too exposed, the damage may be irreversible. And we`re going to have to do more to help them actually learn.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' And you think there`s a federal role on that? You say we –  CLINTON: I think there is a federal role. I would make it a federal role.  Right now, as best I can understand, the governor, the Republican governor, Governor Snyder, is refusing to ask for the triggering of the federal help that he needs in order to take care of the people who are his constituents.  I am just outraged by this. I find it, you know – lead is one of the most pernicious, horrible, toxins that kids are exposed to, and that has such serious long lasting effects on their behavior and their learning.  I would be doing everything I could, and I would be expecting everybody in a position of authority to do the same. Let`s find out how much it`s going to cost to fix the infrastructure problem. I think finally the governor called on the National Guard, deliver water, do what you can to at least avoid further harm.  But we need to do a full-fledged health study to determine of the 99,000 people who live in Flint, who has been exposed, how much? We need to make sure that no mother is mixing any food with water for babies. And so, the information – literally people need to be going door to door.  Because, you know, a lot of folks who are busy, maybe not even paying attention now, so, the churches, civic organization, not just the political authorities need to be fully engaged. And I would pull out every stop.  I think I would look for any provision in the law that would permit me to override the lack of request from the governor if he refuses to still ask for what I think his people deserve to have.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Secretary Clinton, I have one last question for you. I realize we are out of time. Would you give me permission for one more question?  CLINTON: Absolutely.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`ll be right back with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, really. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Joining us again is Secretary Hillary Clinton. Thank for you staying.  CLINTON: I`m so happy to.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' My last question is weird.  CLINTON: OK, let`s have it.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' But it`s about Democratic women.  CLINTON: OK.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I look at Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Elizabeth Warren, I look at governors like Gina Raimondo in Rhode Island, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, that kind of bench for Democratic women in any other year, they would definitely be short-listed for vice president, but the common wisdom says this year there`s no way if any get picked, not if you`re the nominee.  So, is that common wisdom correct, if you`re the nominee real politically speaking, it is out of question for you to choose a running mate?  CLINTON: Absolutely not. Absolutely not.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Really?  CLINTON: Absolutely not.  Look, I am going to do everything I can to be the nominee, so I have the great opportunity to make that decision. We`re living in a very unusual political atmosphere, and we need people who are tough enough, tenacious enough with a track record to take on the forces that are raid against continuing progress, to protect President Obama`s legacy, and the progress and accomplishments that he has labored to achieve here at home and around the world.  So, I`m looking for a team, and the most important member of that team would be whoever I ask to be my running mate. And I`m not ruling anybody out.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' You don`t have to choose from Grizzly Adams Mountainman in order to comfort the people who would be freaked out at the prospect of a woman president?  CLINTON: Well, yes, I`m going to look at a lot of different people.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Grizzly mountain man is not out?  CLINTON: I`m not sure Leo DiCaprio is available, but we`ll see, right? I think what is –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' You have to ask the bear.  CLINTON: Yes, ask the bear.  I think it`s important to really look at the talents, the experience, the energy, the commitment, the stamina, you know? You`re knocked down a lot in this kind of profession, and the people who dust themselves off and getting right back up are the people I feel the closest to. So men, women, I`m going to looking at anybody who can fit that role for me.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former secretary of state, Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton – thank you so much. It`s always great to see you. Thank you for coming.  CLINTON: Great to see you. Thanks.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' We`ve got lots more ahead tonight and we are literally on the phone trying to book the bear for later in the show, or at least Leonardo DiCaprio if we can get through to the bear.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. One says it`s OK to take millions for big banks and tell them what to do.  My plan: break up the big bank, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share. Then, we can expand health care to all and provide universal college education. Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I`m president? You better believe it.  I`m Bernie Sanders, and I approve this message.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' That is the new campaign ad that was just released by the Bernie Sanders for president campaign. It will soon by running in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Senator Sanders` campaign is spending a ton of money on TV ads in those states right now, in the homestretch in both Iowa and New Hampshire.  But this add in particular appears to have set off a minor firestorm, at least inside the Hillary Clinton campaign. Shortly after this particular ad was released, the Clinton campaign set out a press release, denouncing this ad as an attack ad against her, claiming that with this ad, Senator Sanders is the first candidate in the Democratic race to go negative, they`re saying he`s broken his pledge to not run negative ads, attacks.  Given the actual content of the ad, which you just saw, I feel like that reaction is a little over the top from the Clinton campaign. I told Secretary Clinton that tonight, she disagreed with that characterization.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' That`s an oblique criticism of you taking Wall Street donations, but it`s not like something new. It`s not something over the top that means that he`s now this personal attacker in the campaign.  CLINTON: Well, let`s put it into the broader context. Obviously, Senator Sanders has said repeatedly he doesn`t do that, he doesn`t, you know, engage in negative attacks, and I take him at his word, on anything personal. We don`t do that in our side of the debate, you know?  We engage on substantive differences. We have some. He`s been pointing out what he believes to be differences for quite some time from his point of view.  So, I have been pointing out what differences are, because I think the voters expect us to have something of a spirited debate.  What I think people reacted to is that it was a very broad assertion that caught up all Democrats. I mean, basically, it`s also a very direct criticism of President Obama, who you might recall took a lot of funding from the financial industry when he ran in 2008. That didn`t stop him for fighting for the hardest regulations on Wall Street since the Great Depression.  What the president got done and what the Democrats who stood with him got done is a pretty important accomplishment if we`re going to rein in the excesses on Wall Street.  So, it`s a funny kind of charge. It`s sort of a pox on all your houses for all the Democrats, and I think that`s what raised some eyebrows.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Bernie Sanders casting a pox on all Democrats` houses.  That`s criticism from Secretary Clinton you saw here tonight. It might actually be criticism that senator Sanders wouldn`t disagree with. He might wear that as a badge of pride.  Joining us is the great Chris Hayes, who is the smartest guy I know of to explain politics, particularly on the left.  Hello.  CHRIS HAYES, “ALL IN” HOST: Hello. How are you?  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m trying to figure out whether or not that sort of new territory between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.  HAYES: So that was – so I agree with you that the kind of hair on fire response from the Clinton campaign about this ad was a bit much, particularly the last few days saying he`s going to take away your health care more or less. So –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Well, they want to justify how negative they`re going on him –  HAYES: That`s right. So, again, this is all – you know, ain`t bean bag, et cetera.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here`s what was smart about that politically and I think substantively correct, when it`s an attack on Barack Obama. Fundamentally, it is true that the Sanders world view is a world view that the current Democratic Party, the last eight years of – you know, arguably the most successful Democratic president since FDR has been part of the same corrupt system. It has been operating within the general corruption of the system, which is bought and paid for by this sort of plutocratic world, and he wants to somehow break that up.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, he`d say yes, Dodd/Frank was fine, and I support it, but we could have done much more, and I would do much more, because I`m not captured by the same special interests in the same way that a good guy like President Obama is.  HAYES: So, he`s – the difficult line he has to walk with Democratic primary voters is to say that, is to say that like fundamentally, the system needs to be shaken up more than it has been without appearing to criticize Barack Obama which is extremely beloved and popular among Democratic primary voters.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right.  HAYES: So, Hillary Clinton`s – the most politically – the political advantage she has over Bernie Sanders is the degree to which she can hug Barack Obama close to her, because she served in his administration, and also, I think fundamentally is more embedded in the system that Barack Obama has been operating in than Bernie Sanders who I think views himself as, though embedded in it, a critic of it in a sort of fundamental way.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' There`s some base structural things with that. He doesn`t have any super PACs.  HAYES: He is not taking money from big banks. That was an interesting point, for Hillary Clinton to say, look, he took some money from the finance industry, and we got Dodd/Frank.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' And still did good work.  HAYES: The argument on the other side is, yes, frankly, and Dodd/Frank might have been tougher if he hadn`t.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' What do you think will happen in the Democratic primary now that clearly the floodgates are open? I was – it was interesting. The sharp tone from the Clinton campaign and from Secretary Clinton herself towards Bernie Sanders is not very old. It`s really only been a few days.  HAYES: Literally a week, yes, at the most.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, it`s a week on the campaign trail. So, because there started literally just today this coverage of how maybe it`s not a smart move, maybe it`s backfiring, maybe it`s driving a lot of Bernie Sanders fund-raising. I wanted her to say, we`re not going to do that, no, that`s not what I intended. Instead, she went way further down that room. That`s where they`re going.  HAYES: Yes, they are going to attack. And again, I think, you know, so far, we`re mostly in the area of substance. I mean, on the health care, right, which she also sort of re-upped, right?  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Oh, yes, in great detail.  HAYES: I think the part of it that strikes me is implausible is the idea of Bernie Sanders is going to take away your health care. I mean, he`s going to scrap all these programs, right? And it is true. Go read the bill. Yes it does say replace these things.  It also says in the clause that health care is an entitlement, right? So literally in writing grants to people the fact that this health care cannot be taken away.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' She`s saying, if you try to do something so radical, you put the good things that we got at risk.  HAYES: Yes, exactly. That`s this question about really a fundamental question for Democratic primary voters about the level of appetite that they have for sort of like new political fights versus consolidation of the gains of Obama.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, that`s exactly right. That`s it.  HAYES: Risk/aversion. Do you want to relitigate health care? Might that backfire, and you lose the ACA, is a kind of interesting political question and gets to people`s, voters` I think temperament, frankly, more than ideology, or do you want to – yes.  Now, the Sander camp, I think the legitimate thing that`s coming out of the Clinton is I do think the Sanders camp has an obligation to say how you get from A to B, which is to say –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' And they have delayed their explanation in terms of financing this thing. They have delayed.  HAYES: Everyone understand – a Sanders administration is not going to be the Medicare for all act, right? OK, what are the incremental things you can do that moves the system closer to single-payer, right, that wouldn`t be another huge legislative battle over universal health care?  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Right. And that – and that is a substantive fight.  HAYES: Totally.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I think it makes –  HAYES: But it`s not Bernie Sanders is going to take away, I think that part of it –  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Bernie Sanders is putting our existing good things in our health system at risk because he wants to do such a radical thing?  HAYES: That`s right.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I mean, that is basically – I think it makes people very uncomfortable is it`s at turning negative. It`s not personal at this level, but it is turning negative. I think the Sanders camp is less comfortable with that than the Clinton camp is. So, whatever the substantive fight is here, I sort of hope it doesn`t get loss in people feeling so oogie about the tone. This interview tonight confirmed for me that it`s –  HAYES: It`s also not turning back. Like, it`s politics, they`re trying to be the president of the United States.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes. This is hard.  HAYES: It`s amazing that it`s in some ways it hasn`t gotten here sooner. That`s because it is really a tight race right now.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Yes, fascinating. Chris Hayes, host of “ALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES” here on MSNBC – see, I told you, smartest guy in the country to talk to about politics on the left. It`s true.  HAYES: Thank you.  ', 'MADDOW:', ' See you soon.  And while all the attention understandably is focused on the increasingly hot contest between Clinton and Sanders, spare a thought for old Martin O`Malley, who has been suffering headlines like these recently. These are from last week.  Headlines in the Beltway press speculating that`s he might not qualify for the next Democratic debate. The cruddy thing about those headlines, is that at the time those ran, Martin O`Malley was actually watt mathematically on track to make the next Democratic debate and now, in fact, he officially has. So all of that insult for none of the injury, unless those wrong headlines themselves injure his campaign. But Martin O`Malley will in fact be there.  We also now know more about how that next Democratic debate is going to go. It`s this Sunday night, 9:00 Eastern, hosted by NBC News from Charleston, South Carolina. The moderator is going to be Lester Holt from “NBC Nightly News”. He`s going to get help with the questions, though – the candidates will also take questions from Chuck Todd, host of “Meet the Press”, and from the great Andrea Mitchell.  So, now you know what you`ll be doing on Sunday night. The pregame starts at 8:00 Eastern here on MSNBC, the debates kicks off at 9:00 p.m. Sunday night on NBC.  And, yes, martin O`Malley will be there. Leave him alone. Don`t be mean.  We`ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CLINTON: Right now, as best I can understand, the governor, the Republican governor, Governor Snyder, is refusing to ask for the triggering of the federal help that he needs in order to take care of the people who are his constituents. And I am just outraged by this.  I would pull out every stop. I think I would look for any provision in the law that would permit me to override the lack of request from the governor if he refuses to still ask for what I think his people deserve to have.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton here just tonight talking about the lead poisoning disaster in Flint, Michigan, that was actually literally caused by the state government there. She called it infuriating. She said she were outraged. She said if she were president now, she would look for ways to get federal help into Flint, even if they had to find a way around the governor to do it.  So, that was tonight right here. Today, in Michigan, the expressions of outrage were out loud and they started on the capitol steps in Lansing.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (CHANTING)  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You cannot take your signs inside the building.  (CHANTING)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Then they piled inside.  Now, these protesters today, many of whom came to the state capital from Flint. Once they assembled that way, they were told they couldn`t bring their signs in, then they made their way inside.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (CHANTING)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' They streamed in chanting, again without their signs, because they weren`t allowed to bring those in. They made their ways up two flights the stairs, the same chant the entire way.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (CHANTING)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' For context here, the people were making their way through the capitol to Governor Snyder`s office. Yes, it`s largely a ceremonial office, but still.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  (CHANTING)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' There were so many people at this protest today. They filled the rotunda inside the state capitol all the way around, and some people made their way up yet another flight of stairs where the Michigan house was in session. All this happened today.  Flint`s residents, Michigan`s residents making a deliberately loud civil nuisance of themselves, calling on their governor to resign over the state government poisoning the water in Flint. That`s what the residents of Flint traveled by bus to their state capitol to do today.  Meanwhile, back in Flint today, a big announcement on the crisis that was neither by nor about Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. Twice we`ve had, a truly heroic – the local pediatrician who basically realized what was going on and took it upon herself with no funding, with no directive, that she should start testing the kids in Flint to see if they had lead in their blood. It turns out they did, in huge proportions.  And Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha blew the whistle on that as loudly as she could. And the Rick Snyder administration tried to discredit her and told people to ignore her. But she was right. Her data was right. And even now the governor has had to acknowledge that Dr. Mona was right, and he`s now having her stand at his press conferences like they were always working together.  Even now, she`s still now such a bad ass – forgive me. She still such a bad add, that she`s still blowing the whistle on what the Snyder administration is doing right now. She`s still blowing the whistle on the way they are underplaying the crisis. That`s why she was here last night, still this week at that Governor Snyder`s press conference in Flint this week, the administration was still understating the problem, understating the number of people who have been lead poisoned by oh, say, tens of thousands of people.  Such a bad ass, doing such uncompromising brave, good work. Somebody like that you think, God, why isn`t that person in charge?  Well, that`s what happened today in Flint. Now, Dr. Mona is in charge. It was announced today in Flint is that they have now set up the health initiative that`s going to be in charge of testing kids` blood levels and doing long-term monitoring of all of those kids and then doing long-term intervention with all of those thousands of exposed kids to treat what can be treated, to mitigate what can be mitigated, to do whatever intervention can be done to literally try to mitigate the brain damage caused by the lead that all of those kids were exposed to.  Since the scale of this problem became clear, everybody`s basically been saying, my God there`s going to have to be monitoring for years, all these thousands of kids and their families, this is lifelong. They`re going to need help and support for years, maybe for decades.  As soon as you realize how big a problem this was and what happened, immediately you realize that`s what was needed. Well, now, that has finally been set up. They have put Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha in charge of it, which is about the only thing in this whole crisis that just seems right and competent, finally.  Details on how to support the Flint kids fund are online right now, MaddowBlog.com or you can go there directly at Flintkids.com. They`re taking donation from the public.  We`ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Here`s an update. When I asked Hillary Clinton tonight about the lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan, I was surprised by the intensity of her interest in the story, how much she knew about it, but also the force of her critique of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. She called him out for refusing, as she put it, him refusing to ask for federal help. She said she was outraged by his failure to fully engage the federal government in trying to take care of his constituents. She said she found it infuriating.  Given what said and the sort of ferocity, we turned around right quick and asked Governor Snyder for comment tonight. We gave them a transcript of her remarks and we asked for a respond.  We did get back a smidgen of news from governor`s office. The governor`s office tells us this, quote, “Governor Snyder this week spoke to the White House and to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson about what kind of assistance the federal government can provide to help the people of Flint. The governor this week spoke to the regional director of FEMA, which already has staff in Flint, assisting with some aspects of our efforts to help people get the help they need. The governor already has asked for a pledge from FEMA to coordinate an interagency recovery plan that would coordinate other efforts with other federal agencies to provide resources in Flint, and then he said there are tremendous efforts to go door to door to make sure people get filters, bottled water and water tests in homes. We are working on short and long-term plans to address health issues as we move forward.”  So, Governor Snyder says he`s talked to the White House, and specifically to the Homeland Security secretary about this crisis in Flint. That is new news, potential important news for Flint. Still not the same as calling of FEMA to do disaster response. We asked the governor again tonight if he has any plans to do that. We have not gotten an answer to that part of it yet, but stay tuned.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' Debunktion junction, what`s my function? We start with President Obama who held a town hall event this morning as part of his generally quite upbeat, quite happy post-State of the Union tour.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I ran for office in 2007-2008, I did not say yes, I can. I said –  CROWD: Yes, we can!  OBAMA: Yes, we can, people. God bless you. Love you. Thank you, New Orleans. God bless America.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' True or false, President Obama was in Thank you, New Orleans, today?  (BUZZER)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' No, President Obama was not in Thank you, New Orleans. He was 80 miles away in poor put upon Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  OBAMA: God bless you. Thank you, New Orleans.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' And also Baton Rouge.  Next week, the president is expected to hold a similar event at the International Auto Show in Detroit. Thank you in advance, Kalamazoo.  (LAUGHTER)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' I`m so looking forward to doing that. Ha!  All right. Next up, a story from “New Yorker Magazine`s” Jane Mayer who has written about the billionaire conservative activists Koch brothers. Jane Mayer is a great reporter. She`s one of the best of our age. And she has a new book out called “Dark Money.” And in this new book, she tells a story about the Koch brothers` dad, his name was Fred.  Now, before I go any further, I should point out that the Koch brothers are well known to forceful responses to stories they feel slighted by. Trust me.  OK, back to Papa Koch, Fred Koch. Jane Mayer reports that Fred Koch helped build one of the largest oil refineries in Nazi Germany. A refinery that was personality approved by Adolf Hitler.  As you might expect, this story has not pleased the Koch brothers. The story that their dad has helped Hitler.  But is it true or false that Fred Koch, the Koch brothers` dad, from whom they inherited their fortune and business, part of his business is that he helped build an oil refinery for the Nazi? Is that true or is that false?  (RING)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' True. And the reason we know unequivocally that this is true is because Koch Industries was very quick to respond to this story. And despite their anger about their story, their angry response to it had the side benefit of confirming Jane Mayer`s reporting.  They put their response in a letter to Koch Industry`s employees this week. Koch officials wrote, “Between 1928 and 1934, Winkler-Koch Engineering handled more than 500 projects. Of these, 39 involved signed contracts to build cracking units. One of those cracking units was included in the refinery in the port area of Hamburg, Germany. Simply put, it was just one element in the composition of a single refinery.”  Koch brothers only built part of that refinery for the Nazis. They also went to great lengths to point out, all of the other projects that dad`s companies worked on that were not for the Nazis. Neat. Except for that one that was.  Jane Mayer wrote her own response to the Koch`s response essentially thanking them for, quote, “confirming Fred Koch was involved in the creation of a German refinery which Adolf Hitler personally greenlighted.”  We reached to Koch Industries for a comment on Jane Mayer`s response. They directed as back to their letter about how Fred Koch worked on just that one Nazi refinery, which admittedly is almost the same as him working on no Nazi refineries. Almost the same. Almost.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  ', 'MADDOW:', ' So, here`s an intriguing update. This past Friday, we reported that the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court were scheduled to discuss Bob McDonnell. The federal corruption case of Virginia Republican Governor Bob McDonnell. You recall that he was convicted of multiple corruption charges and was sentenced to two years in federal prison.  Governor McDonnell has already lost his appeal at an appeals court, one level below the Supreme Court. So, the supremes considering his case this past Friday, that`s basically his last chance.  It`s a suspenseful thing. Maybe the supremes will come to his rescue and hear his case. If they don`t, though, Governor McDonnell has to go to prison.  The supremes had this case on their docket to consider it on Friday. We had thought that we would get the court`s order on the Bob McDonnell case. We actually thought we would get it on Monday this week.  But it didn`t happen. The justices talked about the case this past Friday but Monday rolled around, all week has rolled around now and they said neither yay nor nay about the case. What is that mean? Intriguing, right?  At base level, at the very least, Bob McDonnell didn`t get told no. His case is still alive. He didn`t have to go to prison this week.  Pete Williams of NBC News also points out that back in August, the justices stepped to in when they didn`t have to and decided Governor Bob McDonnell would not have to report to prison while he still had a shot of taking his case further. Pete Williams told us, quote, “If they thought his appeal was baseless, it`s unlikely they would have done that.”  So maybe these are all good signs for Governor Bob McDonnell. In any event, here`s the very, very intriguing thing that`s happened since. After the justices didn`t say what they would do with his case on Monday, or any other day this week so far, the justices then said they would put it back on the docket to discuss it again starting tomorrow.  So, I don`t know if hope springs eternal for the convicted governor, but hope definitely does have a little more spring in its step than it used to for Bob McDonnell. This is a case we have followed since the beginning. Tomorrow may very well be the biggest day in this case yet. Watch this space.  That does it for us tonight. We`ll se you again tomorrow.  Now, it`s time for “THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL”.  Good evening, Lawrence.   END  ']\n"

       "array([ 'ADVERTISEMENT\\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity\" on a breaking news Friday night. President Trump now traveling for his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief. We\\'ll check in with Dr. Sebastian Gorka. He\\'ll have reaction. Also tonight, Juan Williams, Jay Sekulow, Byron York, Joe Concha, Lisa Boothe, Ric Grenell, Austan Goolsbee all coming up.\\nBut first, all right, the past two weeks -- they\\'ve been nothing like we have ever seen before in American history! President Trump has been attacked with lies and innuendo, late-day news dumps, anonymous sources, breathless hyperventilating reporting. Now, I\\'m going to explain exactly what the president is up against. This is important. We put it all together in tonight\\'s \"Opening Monologue.\"\\nAll right, this week, we\\'ve been telling you about the five groups that are aligned to try and destroy President Trump. Now, they want to undermine the will of you, the American people. Now, these are the threats that we\\'re facing.\\nOne, the deep state. And of course, they\\'re going after President Trump, selectively leaking information. Just look at the disgruntled fired former FBI director James Comey. He\\'s using the press to carry out his own personal vendetta against President Trump.\\nNumber two, the destroy Trump media. These rigid left-wing Hillary- supporting ideologues pushing their tinfoil hat conspiracy theories night after night, breathlessly hyping everything up, one fake news scandal after fake news scandal.\\nNumber three, the Democrats -- really sore losers, obstructionists. They refuse to accept the results that you gave us this election season.\\nThen you\\'ve got weak Republicans, establishment Republicans, feckless, no backbone, no spine. They never supported Trump or his agenda. They\\'re a threat to the president.\\nAnd number five, never-Trumpers, holier than now elitist outlets, National Review, Weekly Standard. They want vindication. They want relevance.\\nAnd then the last two weeks, new pattern of attack is emerging. This is what I want you to pay close attention to. The New York Times, Washington Post constantly using anonymous sources, sources outside of the White House, dropping one huge bombshell report just before the national newscast every night at 6:30 PM, and then, of course, cable coverage right after.\\nThen there\\'s been breathless coverage from the destroy Trump media, their Democratic allies now calling day after day for President Trump\\'s impeachment. Listen to this from earlier this week. You cannot make this stuff up.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the president of the United States of America for obstruction of justice.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are we getting closer and closer to the possibility of yet another impeachment process?\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: After watching the Clinton impeachment, I thought I\\'d never see another one, but I think we\\'re in impeachment territory for the first time.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really?\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are well on our way to impeachment because I think there\\'s a clear set of facts that show obstruction of justice.\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is heading toward the end, right? It has to be, right? It feels that way.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: All right, here\\'s what they\\'re not telling you. The destroy Trump media and the Democrats -- they\\'re not going to tell you many of the stories that you have heard in the last two weeks that they\\'re using to destroy President Trump and hyperventilate every night have now been proven totally false!\\nNow, let\\'s start with the Trump-hating Washington Post. Last week, The Post reported that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein -- he threatened to quit because of Comey\\'s firing. Big alarms that night. Guess what? Rosenstein quickly shot it down. Somebody in the press actually asked him, and he sat on camera for an interview, said no, he\\'s not quitting, never threatened to quit.\\nOn the same day, The Washington Post -- they alleged that before Comey was fired, he requested more resources for the Russia investigation. That\\'s why he got fired. Well, big surprise, The Washington Post wrong again because the acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe, testified the next day that he\\'d never heard such a request.\\nAnd earlier this week, yes, The Post is back. They thought they nailed President Trump! They ran a story claiming the president leaked classified information to the Russians during last week\\'s Oval Office visit. But people that were actually in the room -- now, they cited people outside of the White House -- they said, the people in the room, it never happened.\\nAlso The New York Times -- they\\'re trying to keep up, and they\\'ve been spearing Trump from day one. Earlier this week, the paper of record cited a memo from James Comey which claims that President Trump asked the now former FBI director to end the investigation into retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, that he sent himself a memo. Now, the president, the White House have strongly denied that this ever happened.\\nAnd then, of course, there\\'s the fact that the reporter who wrote the story never even saw the so-called memo. This is fascinating. Watch this.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is it The Times has the story but not the memo?\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we -- we\\'ve been working -- I\\'ve been working on a story the past few days about the fact that Comey had written these. We thought that that was pretty significant in and of itself. And then in the process of pushing on those doors this morning, I learned more about one of these memos. And someone that had seen them recounted details to me.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: As we pointed out, and we have reported on this program -- now, in January, if, in fact, they had a memo and he said that President Trump was trying to encourage him to obstruct justice, well, guess what? That would have been two felonies that James Comey would have committed because James Comey has a legal obligation to report that immediately to the Justice Department, which, by the way, he didn\\'t do.\\nAnd then he testified in May and he said guess what? Nobody ever tried to get me to obstruct justice. Whoops!\\nAnd tonight, The New York Times is at it again. You can\\'t make it up. And they\\'re claiming that President Trump called James Comey, quote, a \"nutjob.\"\\nBut go back to the memo. The Times alluding, the president trying to get the FBI to back away from Flynn. By law, he would have had to report this immediately to the Justice Department. He was so alarmed, why didn\\'t he say it immediately? Why didn\\'t he report it immediately?\\nNow, by not doing so, Comey may have broken the two laws we\\'re discussing. They\\'re up there on the side of your screen. Take a look at them.\\nThen there\\'s the fact that when Comey appeared before Congress on May 3rd -- well, remember? He was asked about the potential for interference with an FBI investigation. Well, did that ever happen? Wouldn\\'t it be big if it happened? This is what he said.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?\\nJAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: In theory, yes.\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has it happened?\\nCOMEY: Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that -- without appropriate purpose. I mean, we\\'re oftentimes, they give us opinions that, We don\\'t see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I\\'m talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal. It\\'s not happened in my experience.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Not happened. President Trump then asked James Comey to stop looking into Michael Flynn. Wouldn\\'t that have been the perfect time to bring it up? And he said it never happened. Remember, that meeting was in January. This was in May when he testified.\\nAnd last week, during a congressional hearing, the acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe -- he said there\\'s been no efforts to impede the Russia investigation, in spite of everything your friends in the news media that lie to you every night are telling you.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the American people want to know, has the dismissal of Mr. Comey in any way impeded, interrupted, stopped or negatively impacted any of the work, any investigation or any ongoing projects at the Federal Bureau of Investigation?\\nANDREW MCCABE, ACTING FBI DIRECTOR: The work of the men and women of the FBI continues, despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions. So there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: What you\\'re seeing play out here is well orchestrated, well organized attack. They want to take down a sitting U.S. president, Democrats, the propaganda media. They\\'re throwing everything they have at President Trump, and the deep state. And now instead of working on making the country a better place, enacting their agenda, the president is now forced to spend the majority of his time defending the lies, the smears, the conspiracy theories.\\nNow, here\\'s what everyone is missing. The left is successful because they\\'ve been able to slow down his agenda dramatically. That\\'s a win for them because they\\'re not thinking about you and what you voted for this election, the economy, creating jobs, fixing health care, foreign policy. No! They want to create chaos because they think that brings them back to power. That\\'s what\\'s at stake here.\\nHere with reaction, from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jay Sekulow, the co-host for \"The Five,\" Juan Williams. Guys, good to see you both.\\nJay, let\\'s -- let\\'s -- this is very, very important. James Comey, if, in fact, he thought the president was obstructing justice and didn\\'t report it-- do those two felonies I put up -- do they play out for him? Would he have violated the law?\\nJAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Sure. He had an affirmative obligation at that point to go to the officials within the Department of Justice and report that a crime had been committed, or at least an attempted crime had been committed. And he didn\\'t do that.\\nBut I also would add one other thing. James Comey\\'s not exactly a credible witness. This is a guy that\\'s had to correct his testimony to the Congress on multiple occasions. The most recent time was just a few days before he was fired.\\nAnd you also had -- you played the statement by Rod Rosenstein about -- regarding the -- you know, there was this -- all that rumors about him, you know, threatening to quit. And he was also asked (INAUDIBLE) I think yesterday. He was asked if he stood by his recommendation that James Comey be fired. He said yes. The handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal was a basis upon which James Comey should be fired.\\nThere you have it. No scandal. That\\'s the law.\\nHANNITY: And he also laid out felony after felony that Hillary committed. All right--\\nSEKULOW: Yes.\\nHANNITY: -- and that goes to the e-mail server scandal, didn\\'t investigate the foundation. And we know that releasing intelligence like they did on Michael Flynn -- we know that violates the Espionage Act.\\nJuan, I guess my question for you is, when a story comes out and it turns out not to be true, like in this particular case, you know, how does the media get away with that and they keep just making, as The Washington Post three mistakes in a week?\\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Wow. Well, first of all, I guess you think they made a mistake. I\\'m not sure they think they made a mistake. So -- but let\\'s just look back at your monologue, Sean. I was really impressed.\\nHANNITY: Thank you.\\nWILLIAMS: I mean, you blame The Weekly Standard. You blame The National Review. You blamed establishment Republicans. I was -- you really think everybody is against Donald Trump. I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t mention Obama.\\nHANNITY: Well, they\\'ve been -- wait a minute! Obama hates him, too.\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nHANNITY: He\\'s a threat to the swamp!\\nWILLIAMS: What?\\nHANNITY: But that is -- those five components, what I\\'m arguing is the swamp. And he threatens -- he\\'s an existential threat to all of those groups. And they -- the Republicans, weak Republicans and never-Trumpers, hated him from day one.\\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think there are people who don\\'t like Donald Trump. I don\\'t think there\\'s any question. I thought you were on target when you said the Democrats who still haven\\'t gotten over the election -- I agree with you that.\\nBut drain the swamp? Goldman Sachs, all over the place? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think that, in fact, the people that you point out elected Donald Trump, think that he has gone in, replaced and repealed ObamaCare effectively, done something to spur job growth in our country. I just don\\'t see it, Sean.\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nSEKULOW: Yes. I mean, first of all, you\\'ve got right now a media filibuster going on. That\\'s what they\\'re doing. They\\'re utilizing the media to stop any agenda moving forward.\\nBut you know, I had the opportunity to visit with the president yesterday, and I will tell that you despite what you\\'re hearing, there\\'s a lot of work being done. Let\\'s not forget Neil Gorsuch confirmed. Let\\'s not forget that the repeal of ObamaCare has gone through the House of Representatives. Let\\'s not forget that yesterday, Syrian forces--\\nHANNITY: Regulations--\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nSEKULOW: -- successfully.\\nHANNITY: All of this.\\nSEKULOW: Right, regulations rolled back. Also, by the way, on abortion funding, which for a lot of people including me that are pro-life, it\\'s a big deal on international funding. That executive order was issued--\\nHANNITY: Let me -- let me--\\nSEKULOW: -- signed not challenged.\\nHANNITY: Let me ask you both something--\\nSEKULOW: I mean, the -- the -- so there\\'s been success, but it\\'s a media filibuster.\\nHANNITY: Let me -- let me ask you both. All of this -- and -- and both Clapper and Admiral Rogers have both said that there\\'s no evidence as it relates to Russian collusion. All the narrative and the hysteria in the media seems to surround this. So I want to ask you this question.\\nAnd I am not backing off asking questions, even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich. Now, I\\'ve interviewed Julian Assange on radio and TV many times. And I\\'ve asked him about where those Wikileaks DNC emails came from that resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz\\'s firing.\\nThis kid got shot in the back. They said it was a robbery. Yet he had his watch, his wallet and his phone. I don\\'t believe it\\'s a robbery.\\nBut I asked Julian, was it the Russians? And then listen to what Julian said in a Dutch interview.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did Russia give you this information, or anybody associated with Russia?\\nJULIAN ASSANGE, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER: Our source is not a state party, so the answer for our interactions is no.\\nWhistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. There\\'s a 27-year-old works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington. So--\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn\\'t it?\\nASSANGE: No. There\\'s no finding. So--\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you suggesting? What are you suggesting?\\nASSANGE: I\\'m suggesting that our sources take risks, and they become concerned to see things occurring like that.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But was he one of your sources then? I mean--\\nASSANGE: We don\\'t comment on who our sources are.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: By the way, my thoughts and prayers go out to this family, Jay Sekulow, then I want Juan to really fully respond. If he says it\\'s not Russia and he sounds -- he comes so close to the line saying it was this kid. Let\\'s put the kid out of it for a minute. I feel sorry for his family.\\nSEKULOW: Yes.\\nHANNITY: But what if it was somebody that was so disgruntled in the DNC at how they cheated Bernie and how the fix was in, if that turned out to be true that somebody did that, wouldn\\'t that completely wipe out the entire Russia lie we\\'ve heard for months and months?\\nSEKULOW: Of course. And by the way, not only would it wipe that out, but Dianne Feinstein, the senator from California, when asked about evidence involving Russian collusion, she says she has seen to date none. So we\\'ve got Clapper and Feinstein, Sally Yates, the entire -- no one has -- this is a fake story!\\nAnd the fact is -- I understand why the media likes to deal with this. But the reality is that the leaks information, wherever the source was for Wikileaks, whatever that source was, or whether that person is alive or not, the fact is it was the e-mails themselves--\\nHANNITY: All right, let me--\\nSEKULOW: -- that caused Hillary Clinton the problem, not the fact that they were leaked. You know, I don\\'t like leaks. No one likes leaks.\\nHANNITY: That\\'s such a good point.\\nSEKULOW: What was in it was the problem. Yes. That\\'s--\\nHANNITY: But you know, Juan, when you -- when you listen to Julian deny Russia, talk about one individual -- but let\\'s put aside the individual -- knowing that Bernie was cheated and they stole it from him, they colluded, does that not raise eyebrows that this whole thing could be a lie to you?\\nWILLIAMS: Well, what did Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip, say earlier? He said somebody -- he thinks Putin is paying Trump. Now, that was before Wikileaks. That was before anybody knew anything--\\nSEKULOW: Juan, do you believe -- Juan do believe--\\nWILLIAMS: -- about that.\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nWILLIAMS: Do I believe that Kevin McCarthy said it? Yes. In fact, apparently--\\nSEKULOW: No, do you believe--\\nWILLIAMS: -- there\\'s a tape of that.\\nSEKULOW: Do you -- Juan, you\\'re a smart guy. Do you believe that Vladimir Putin paid Donald Trump, the president of the United States?\\nWILLIAMS: I don\\'t know. Remember, he won\\'t release his tax returns.\\nSEKULOW: You think he might have?\\nWILLIAMS: We don\\'t know exactly what was being funded--\\nSEKULOW: Oh, OK.\\nWILLIAMS: -- by oligarchs and other people. We don\\'t know. So I don\\'t want to believe that and I don\\'t have any evidence of it, so--\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nHANNITY: Last question.\\nWILLIAMS: But I\\'m just telling you, when you ask me about, is this evidence that Russia had nothing to do with it, I would say to you, Come on, guys. There are cut-outs. And we don\\'t know what cutouts were used to feed that information to Assange.\\nHANNITY: All right, we got to run.\\nWILLIAMS: And why would you trust Assange when I\\'ve heard Sean Hannity and Jay Sekulow say this guy\\'s a traitor to the United States?\\nHANNITY: I got to roll. Good to see you guys.\\nUp next on this busy breaking Friday news night, President Trump traveling to Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief. Will he go on an apology tour? He\\'s slated to give a speech about radical Islam on Sunday. I doubt it. Up next, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.\\nAnd also tonight--\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Pence, vice president of the United States, is either a sucker and a dupe for Donald Trump, is being set up that way and go and lie and lie and lie again, or he\\'s a liar.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: The destroy Trump media continues with their biased, abusively biased reporting. We get reaction, Joe Concha, Byron York.\\nBut disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner facing years behind bars after pleading guilty to sexting with a teen. And we\\'ll check in with that on this busy news night straight ahead.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, President Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia in the first stop on his first foreign trip. Now, as president this morning, before he left, President Trump tweeted, quote, \"Getting ready for my big foreign trip, will be strongly protecting America\\'s interests. That\\'s what I like to do.\"\\nNow, while in Saudi Arabia, the president expected to give a major speech on the need to confront radical Islam. Joining us now, the deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.\\nYou know -- you know, I keep talking about the cycle, the breathless reporting, all the phony stories, New York Times, Washington Post, I mentioned in the last segment. And here\\'s the president -- he had a great relationship, connection with the Chinese president that is bearing fruit vis-a-vis troops on the border with North Korea. Beef industry is being helped out. You know, really good connection.\\nHe met with the Saudi prince, the Israeli prime minister, king of Jordan and the president -- President el-Sisi of Egypt. He\\'s making a lot of progress. He\\'s taking on terror in -- as we know, in Syria and elsewhere.\\nBut all people want to talk about -- they gave secrets away because somebody outside the White House that wasn\\'t in the room said so! Is it hard for the president to govern with all this garbage that\\'s going on?\\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Not at all, Sean. Not at all. We know this for what it is. I think you used the word yourself earlier this week. It\\'s not news. It\\'s not reporting. It\\'s just propaganda.\\nAnd we have a mission that we had approved by the American people, and we\\'re executing it. Look, if you had any idea -- and I\\'m sure you do because you know these people -- the feelings in the Middle East in these countries that the president is going to visit -- finally, there\\'s American leadership. Finally, we\\'re going to treat our friends like friends after eight years of our allies and partners being shunned! And we\\'re going to be victorious against groups like ISIS and al Qaeda.\\nSo yes, there\\'s -- you know, there\\'s -- there\\'s what the media says and then there\\'s reality. And we live in the world of reality, Sean, the president and his team.\\nHANNITY: You know, Dr. Gorka, you wrote a book about that we can defeat radical Islam. Is there this new emerging alliance -- Israel, the Saudis, the Jordanians, and maybe the Emirates emerging that could be a force, that could take on Iranian hegemony, radical Islam and ISIS all at the same time and actually win?\\nGORKA: Absolutely. Look at part of the trip is going to include the closing of a $110 billion deal for Saudi Arabia that will help push back on Iranian influence, that will help secure the region. We can\\'t talk about it here openly, but the relationship between Israel and key Arab Muslim nations of the region has changed dramatically in the last 16 weeks. Why? Because now they know, with American help, with American leadership, we can secure that region and we can eradicate.\\nRemember what the president said, we are going to obliterate and eradicate these groups, and finally, we have a commander-in-chief who will make that possible.\\nHANNITY: You know, one of the things that I think I\\'m most concerned about is -- I didn\\'t like Rex Tillerson\\'s comments about -- he seemed to be sort of using his negotiating chip the idea of moving the capital to Jerusalem. I\\'m not sure if I agree with that.\\nThe second thing is, is it possible to have any peace with the Palestinians, with the Israelis, if they continue to pay terrorists and their families large sums of money, hundreds of millions of dollars after they kill innocent men, women and children, Israelis and Americans? I don\\'t see how it\\'s possible.\\nGORKA: Look, so first things first. There is no final decision on the capital, but you heard it from the vice president\\'s mouth on the day of national independence for Israel, the president is very, very seriously looking at this issue. But there\\'s the broader question of the larger deal and this related to it.\\nTo your second point, yes, there has to be a fundamental change. There has to be behavior modification if we\\'re going to have peace in a deal brokered by this administration. It\\'s not -- it\\'s not going to be another piece of paper. It\\'s not going to be a nice summit somewhere.\\nIf this happens, it\\'s going to happen for real because we have the world\\'s best deal maker, but it has to happen only after certain things change with regards to exactly those issues you discussed, with regard to terrorism, payment of terrorist families and other key issues.\\nHANNITY: One thing I know is not going to be happening, Dr. Gorka. This is not going to be an apology tour. That will be refreshing. Good to see you.\\nAnd coming up on this busy breaking Friday news night here on \"Hannity\"--\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG, \"THE VIEW\": There have been a couple who have been perhaps treated more unfairly or as unfairly. Let\\'s talk about, I don\\'t know, Barack Obama.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: All right, \"The View\\'s\" Whoopi Goldberg says President Obama was treated, oh, just as unfairly, or even moreso than President Trump. We have a new study just released -- it proves that\\'s not true. We\\'ll get reaction from Joe Concha and Byron York.\\nAnd also on this busy Friday news night--\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked, the \"lock her up, lock her up,\" all of that was developed, I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Vladimir Putin did it! Of course. The Democrats won\\'t stop pushing the bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. Lisa Boothe, Ric Grenell weigh in.\\nAlso, disgraced former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner pleading guilty to sexting with a teenager. He could spend years behind bars -- straight ahead.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nJACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, and live from America\\'s news headquarters, I\\'m Jackie Ibanez in New York.\\nFormer FBI director James Comey agreeing to go before a Senate committee. He will testify after Memorial Day. No specific date set just yet. The Senate Intelligence Committee releasing a statement tonight, saying they hope his testimony helps answer the questions about his dismissal by President Trump. The Trump administration has yet to comment.\\nAnd former New York Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner pleading guilty to felony charges for sexting a 15-year-old girl. He will now have to register as a sex offender and he may serve time in prison. His wife Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, filing for divorce after his plea.\\nAnd a judge tossing out the civil rights lawsuit by a Texas teenager against his high school. Ahmed Mohamed was dubbed \"clock boy\" after he was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to class. School officials said it looked like a bomb and called police.\\nI\\'m Jackie Ibanez. Now back to \"Hannity.\" Enjoy your night.\\nHANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Tonight time for our \"Fake News Roundup.\" Over the past 24 hours the mainstream media\\'s coverage has been downright vicious. You can\\'t make this stuff up. It\\'s every single hour of every day.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are there are echoes of Watergate here in your mind with this type of response by the president, the combativeness over this?\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There certainly are.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The obvious parallel is with President Nixon in his late days.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even his allies see him as a 70-year-old impulsive, needy, adolescent who does not know his job and has no since of strategy.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump actually sounding far less articulate than the president of Colombia who actually seems to speak our language much better than Donald Trump.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Pence, vice president of the United States, is either a sucker and a dupe for Donald Trump, being set up that way to go out and lie and lie and lie again, or he\\'s a liar. There is no middle ground.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Now, I want you to keep that montage in mind when you listen to this clip from \"The View\\'s\" Whoopi Goldberg who recently said President Obama was treated much worse than Donald Trump. Really? Watch this.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nGOLDBERG: I did want to point out there have been a couple who have been perhaps treated more unfairly, or as unfairly. Let\\'s talk about, I don\\'t know, Barack Obama. This guy went for eight years and came out still a man I\\'m proud, whether you like what he did, I\\'m proud of him.\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Maybe Whoopi didn\\'t see the new Harvard study because that found Trump\\'s coverage during his first 100 days set a new standard for negativity. In fact the study shows a whopping 80 percent of President Trump\\'s media coverage has been negative compared to just 41 percent for Obama.\\nJoining us now, Fox News contributor Byron York, and from The Hill Joe Concha. All right, Joe, we know it. We see it. It\\'s every night. But one thing you can\\'t measure is the breathless intensity that also goes along with the coverage.\\nJOE CONCHA, THE HILL: Oh, tone is definitely a factor here, Sean, no question about it. But peel the onion off the study. It is fascinating. As a media reporter I love really digging into this.\\nLet me just make three quick points here. Immigration coverage was 96 percent negative. I get that the temporary travel ban wasn\\'t rolled out well. But then the reason why that number is so far in the negative direction is because border crossings being down 70 percent is rarely reported. So that\\'s why you get a number like that.\\nNumber two, foreign policy and defense. You would have to argue that probably the biggest event that happened during the first 100 days of Trump was the bombing of that Syrian airfield after that chemical attack by Assad\\'s forces that killed women and children. That was even applauded by Democrats. And 82 percent negative -- with a team of Tillerson, Madison, McMaster, that\\'s the negativity you are getting even in that area.\\nBut economy, Sean, economy, where most people would say Trump is doing a good job because when you look at unemployment rate at 10-year low. Manufacturing, construction booming. You know, jobless claims at 28 year low, on and on, I can go on and on. Most of the economic numbers are good. And even there, Sean.\\nHANNITY: The economic numbers are good.\\nCONCHA: Even there, it\\'s negatives. And that tells me something. That tells me there is a reflex toward the negative even when numbers that you can\\'t spin are being spun anyway.\\nHANNITY: Joe, they can spin anything. They lie. That\\'s part of their strategy. Byron?\\nBYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, in addition to that 80 percent figure that you said at the top, which is the overall figure, 80 percent negative, if you look at some of the individual outlets, the numbers are really pretty amazing. CNN and NBC were both 93 percent negative. CBS 91 percent negative. New York Times 87 percent negative. The Washington Post, 83. Wall Street Journal a little more fair, 70 percent negative. And Fox News 52 percent negative, 48 percent positive, roughly balanced there. But some of these negative numbers were just through the roof.\\nHANNITY: I agree with that. You know, Joe, you have your colleagues in the media, I notice you are a little separate and apart from a lot of them, especially on Twitter where they\\'re like you tweet my story, I\\'ll tweet your story. Is there a group think that is almost impenetrable now?\\nCONCHA: I think that there\\'s a peer pressure, Sean, as far as -- I look at Matt Lauer. And if you remember that commander-in-chief forum, it was on the Intrepid here in New York. And Lauer did a good question. He asked actually Trump twice as many questions as Hillary. But people, because he didn\\'t throw a pie in Donald Trump\\'s face and kneecap him, he was basically ostracized from the Hamptons. And that set a tone right there that if you aren\\'t overwhelmingly negative, not even so much towards Trump but his surrogates that go on the air, then we are going to really going to ream you on social media, no question.\\nHANNITY: Last word, Byron?\\nYORK: Back in the pre-cable era, ABC, CBS, NBC newscasts, the producers basically read the New York Times and just illustrated it later in the day. And I think we are kind of returning to those days where we are seeing just a real set of group think in a sort of echo chamber of stories that appear in a couple of outlets that then spread throughout a number of other outlets.\\nHANNITY: Look, there was a funny story in The Business Insider.\\nJournalists drink too much, are bad at managing emotions, and operate at lower level than average according to a new study. But they hate me so what do I know?\\nYORK: That\\'s not an explanation.\\nHANNITY: That\\'s true. It\\'s not. That\\'s not excuse for their sloppiness and their propaganda.\\nUp next tonight on this busy Friday breaking news night.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nREP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIFORNIA; When you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked, the \"lock her up, lock her up,\" all of that was developed, I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters continues to say and expand on bizarre conspiracy theories. Also tonight, creepy former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner could be going to jail after pleading guilty today to sexting with a teen. We\\'ll get reaction, Lisa Boothe, Ric Grenell.\\nAnd later one-on-one I go with Obama economic advisor Austan Goolsbee. Stay with us.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Democratic California Congresswoman Maxine Waters is at it again. She\\'s now floating one of the most bizarre conspiracy theories coming from the Democratic side of the aisle. This is a great one. Watch this.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nWATERS: I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump\\'s mouth was a play from Putin\\'s playbook. I think that when you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked, the \"lock her up, lock her up,\" all of that was developed -- I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Now, Congresswoman Waters she didn\\'t stop there naturally. She went on to predict Donald Trump\\'s impeachment, all while admitting she has no evidence to back up her accusation. Take a look.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just to be clear, there has been no actual evidence yet.\\nWATERS: No there has not been. No there has not. And I want you to know every time I have talked about impeachment, I\\'ve said we have got to connect the dots. We\\'ve got to get the facts. We have got to do the investigation. That is what leads to impeachment. And I also said that Trump will lead us right there.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: And also tonight, another sad development in the life of disgraced former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner. He pled guilty today to one count of sending obscene messages to a minor. Now as part of a plea deal for sexting an under-aged girl, well earlier in court, Weiner sobbed as he was entering his plea telling the judge, quote, \"I have a sickness but I do not have an excuse.\" Weiner now faces multiple years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender.\\nJoining us now, Lisa Booth, former spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Ric Grenell. Lisa --\\nLISA BOOTHE, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Hi, Sean.\\nHANNITY: I didn\\'t think it could get any better than Dan Rather saying that Donald Trump is now the hunted by the media. I think Maxine Waters got pretty close with the \"lock her up\" came from Putin.\\nBOOTHE: Yes, absolutely, Sean. And I hate to be mean here, Sean, but there is a little bit of a humor in Maxine Waters talking about connecting the dots because this is a woman who on an interview just recently couldn\\'t explain what the Democratic Party stood for outside of the resistance to President Trump. This is a woman who had also previously said that Comey had zero credibility but in an interview struggled to explain why someone with no credibility shouldn\\'t be fired. So there is a little bit of humor for her to talk about connecting the dots when, you know, she is not exactly known for having credibility herself here. But you are right, Sean, we should be dealing with facts, and I think that the media has largely been interested in search of a narrative instead of the facts.\\nHANNITY: I don\\'t even know. Vladimir gave Trump, his audience at town hall \"lock her up.\" Really, Ric? I don\\'t know what zone we are entering here anymore it\\'s gotten so bizarre.\\nRIC GRENELL, FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Yes. Look, and it\\'s a byproduct of anonymous leaks. And no one should be surprised by that the public or Congress or 68 members of Congress who didn\\'t show up for the inauguration somehow are believing these anonymous leaks.\\nLook, I think that the leaks are very serious problem because they are not whistle blowers, these leakers. They are not speaking truth to power. This is politics. This is about 2020. And we have a major problem when intelligence officials are politicizing their work in order to further some political partisan --\\nHANNITY: The dark state.\\nGRENELL: I think they need to be fired. You need to find them and fire them.\\nHANNITY: Agreed.\\nGRENELL: Every single leaker is not helping America. They may think that they are. They may think they are a whistleblower. And the media are never going to tell us who this person is or what the position is. We don\\'t even know if they are actually inside the government, Sean.\\nHANNITY: Well, I would imagine they are in a deep state. That\\'s my suspicion, my deeply held position. But, think about it. Dan Rather, I can\\'t even believe these words are flying out of my mouth. He is kind of right. He was just on. They are hunting the president. He is the hunted. And it\\'s the deep state. It\\'s the Democrats. It\\'s the media. They are hunting him.\\nBOOTHE: And, Sean, I think it\\'s really sad because there is not a lot of credibility there left with the media. They have gotten so much wrong even just with the firing of James Comey recently in saying -- reports that he was fired because there weren\\'t enough resources. But we know that is not to be true because acting FBI director Andrew McCabe told us so he under sworn testimony.\\nThere is also reports that the acting A.G. in regard to the Russia case, Rod Rosenstein, was going to ask resign. That ended up not being true either. So there has just been so much false reporting that I think it\\'s really sad because Americans don\\'t know what to believe.\\nHANNITY: Ric, last word.\\nGRENELL: I think we must find each and every leaker because it\\'s really doing a disservice to democracy. We had an election. We have a lot of reporters who aren\\'t doing journalism. They are getting handed anonymous leaks. That\\'s not journalism. We have to get back to journalism. We have to get back to the fact that we had an election.\\nReporters who are upset about the election or individuals inside the intelligence community who don\\'t like the outcome must be stopped. This cannot continue. And the Democrats, I urge them to think about this. This is just the slippery slope. If it happens to Trump, it\\'s going to happen forever. And our country is at risk. We have got to stop this.\\nHANNITY: These unnamed deep state bureaucrats, they will decide, not the people. That\\'s scary. Thank you both.\\nBOOTHE: Thank you, Sean.\\nHANNITY: When we come back, President Trump set to unveil his budget proposal next week. The prior administration left him with a complete mess. One-on-one, me and former economic adviser for Obama, Austan Goolsbee, straight ahead.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So President Trump\\'s first budget will be released next week. And we are getting a sneak peek at what it will include. According to reports the president is planning to propose $200 billion in infrastructure spending over 10 years. There will also be substantial cuts to food stamps and other programs. President Obama, well, he left President Trump with an economic mess. This is just one step needed to clean it all up. Will it work?\\nJoining us now, former Obama economic advisor Austan Goolsbee. You know, there was a report out this weekend, I thought of you, because we\\'re such good friends. So we didn\\'t --- the first time ever a sitting president never reached three percent GDP growth ever in the history of the country for single year. We might have four percent growth next month alone. I\\'m sure that would make you feel very happy in the Trump effect would make you very gleeful.\\nAUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISER: Well, Sean, I love coming on and talking to you though even in just that sentence you confused two numbers. The president Obama hit three percent on a quarterly basis, which I predict Donald Trump probably will the second quarter. It was less than one percent last quarter.\\nHANNITY: He\\'s the only president ever in a year, he\\'s the only president in the history of the country to never reach three percent growth in a year.\\nGOOLSBEE: For the whole year.\\nHANNITY: I said that. That\\'s correct.\\nGOOLSBEE: Yes. Donald Trump had less than one percent in the first quarter and now if he gets a single quarter --\\nHANNITY: With all due respect, what\\'s the date he became the president. What\\'s the date Donald Trump became president? I know you know history.\\nGOOLSBEE: It\\'s one of the darkest days in our recent memory, January 20th.\\n(LAUGHTER)\\nHANNITY: But the bottom line is that would be Obama\\'s month and Obama\\'s quarter.\\nIf you look down the list, I think there was one quarter in eight years, maybe tow that he got three percent. That\\'s it. Under two, that\\'s a fact.\\nGOOLSBEE: Sean, you are a believer. And that\\'s one of your most endearing qualities.\\nHANNITY: Are you going to pat me on the head and patronize me.\\nGOOLSBEE: Even a believer, it\\'s OK to admit Donald Trump has disappointed you and that you had falsely placed faith in what he was going to do.\\nHANNITY: Not at all.\\n(CROSSTALK)\\nHANNITY: Hang on a second.\\nGOOLSBEE: -- doing what you wanted him to do.\\nHANNITY: We have argued on this program for years. And I have kind of playfully admonished you as being the architect of, let\\'s see, the lowest labor participation rate since the 70s, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty.\\nGOOLSBEE: And 15 million jobs.\\nHANNITY: Lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. So you kind of want to flip it on me because you supported -- and a doubling of the debt which is irresponsible and unpatriotic according to somebody.\\nGOOLSBEE: All I want to do is take out the Bush recession and start it from that, but continue.\\nHANNITY: You know what I would like to do. I would like to take out the incorrigible years that the police took me home to my mother. But that\\'s not way life works.\\nGOOLSBEE: And that was two years ago.\\n(LAUGHTER)\\nHANNITY: My mother has been gone a long time, rest her soul.\\nI would think -- I\\'m never going to win this argument. It\\'s an old argument between us.\\nGOOLSBEE: I agree with that. You won\\'t.\\nHANNITY: All right, because I do win. Facts say a lot of things. But I guess the thing is I would hope that you think that America needs what the president is offering. I\\'m not so sure I love all the infrastructure, but I do love the tax cuts. I love reoperation. I do love energy independence, the jobs that can be created and process of getting there. Are those things we can agree on?\\nGOOLSBEE: I think we can agree that we want to get the growth rate higher for sure. I would love it if we could have a sustained growth rate above three percent not just for one year, for 10 years. That would be wonderful.\\nBut I have some problems with some of the things that Trump is proposing to do because I think they are redistributive, nonsensical, don\\'t increase the growth rate. But if he did some solid infrastructure that would be good. If he had decent tax reform, that would be good.\\nHANNITY: Yes, but the infrastructure, what I like about it going to do private-public partnerships. All right, Austan, I still like you, and please tell your better half.\\nGOOLSBEE: Always have a good time, man.\\nHANNITY: All right, my friend, thank you. And when we come back, a very important Friday \"Question of the Day.\" Stay with us.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: All right, time for our \"Question of the Day\" on this busy Friday night. So what do you think that President Trump will accomplish during his first overseas trip. I know it\\'s not about Russia, really. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think.\\nThat\\'s all the time we have this evening. Thank you for being with us. See you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend.\\nEND\\n'], dtype=object)"

       "\"SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to HANNITY. And this is a Fox News alert.\\nWe have a lot of breaking news about the Florida high school shooter, confessing to killing 17 people.\\nAnd also breaking at this hour, new questions about how all of the warning signs surrounding the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, were missed. What went wrong, and why did so many red flags go unnoticed? We're going to have a comprehensive discussion tonight.\\nAlso tonight in the face of unspeakable evil, violence, tragedy, people rose up to protect other people. We're going to show you heroes that saved lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\\nAnd while politicians, the media, they're all pointing fingers, placing game, giving you the same predictable talking points, tonight, we will offer solutions. How do we protect students at schools all across the country? Answers. That is in tonight's breaking news opening monologue.\\nHANNITY: We start tonight with breaking news and details about the investigation into this horrific tragic Florida high school shooting. The 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz, he has now confessed to slaughtering 17 innocent people and wounding at least a dozen others.\\nCruz is also telling investigators details of the sinister attack. He shot students in the hallway. He fired into five separate classrooms and Cruz also confessed to authorities that he had extra ammunition in his backpack. We're also learning disturbing new details of missed warning signs in what is now one of the worst mass shootings in American history. All of the red flags were there but tragically, Nikolas Cruz was able to commit this heinous act.\\nThe FBI is, in fact, confirming tonight that in September, a YouTube user, with the name Nikolas Cruz spelled the name the same way as the shooter was reported to the bureau for writing, quote: I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\\nThe man who reported the comments said that the FBI visited him the following day but the bureau is saying today that it could not be determined the time, the location, and actual identity of who posted the comment.\\nOur own Catherine Herridge as she noted earlier today all the FBI would have had to do is trace the IP address which is a routine practice to determine the location of the individual. For some reason, it didn't happen in this case.\\nThe mayor of Broward County is saying that Nikolas Cruz was being treated at a mental health clinic but stop seeking treatment more than a year ago. And authorities are describing his social media post as beyond disturbing.\\nJust take a look at some of these pictures. You can see the suspect. Is he seen posing with guns and knives and even dead animals. And former classmates of Cruz say he was a loner, he was obsessed with firearms. He liked to show off pictures of all of his weapons.\\n'The Miami Herald' is reporting that Cruz had been suspended for fighting and having ammunition in his backpack and Cruz was then later expelled for disciplinary reasons and was attending a school in Broward County for at risk students. Cruz also had problems at home. Both parents adopted him and his brother are dead. His mother passed away in November.\\nThe suspect was staying with a friend's family and there were also reports of Nikolas Cruz having ties to a Florida-based white supremacist group. But law enforcement said earlier today that they haven't seen any of those connections. We'll continue to monitor.\\nWhat's also very troubling tonight is how students are describing their former classmate. Now, this is what they say about the shooter, Nikolas Cruz. Let's watch.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He definitely had just some things a little off about him. It was just more or less that he was aggressive and quiet and shy about when he got aggressive.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: His personality was like very different.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was a bit off. He would like curse randomly in the middle of lunch. You know, he would just like scream out random curse words. Like he always seemed a little bit off, you know. Just something was wrong with him.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of like crazy stuff that he did. Just not -- he got kicked out of school most of the time. Honestly people were saying it was going to be him. Joked like that saying that he would be the one to shoot up the school, but it turns out, you know, everyone predicted it.\\nThat's crazy.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Just like with other mass shooters, there were signs, there were warnings of mental, social, emotional problems. But all the pieces were never put together to prevent this tragedy from happening. And like with many other shootings and terrorist attacks, Nikolas Cruz was telegraphing his attentions all over social media.\\nAside from the obvious fact that anyone that would commit these horrible acts of evil and violence are completely deranged, the one commonality between the gunman and Parkland, Florida to Southerland, Texas, to the church in South Carolina, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech are mental health issues and mental illness.\\nDuring an address to the nation earlier today, the president offered his deepest condolences and highlighted this issue of mental health. Let's take a look.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We comfort the grieving and the wounded. And we hurt for the entire community of Parkland, Florida, that is now in shock and pain and searching for answers. To law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger, we thank you for your courage.\\nWe are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation's governors and attorney generals where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: Profound words from the president saying it's not enough to feel better. It's got to make a difference.\\nHe is also, the president is, planning to visit Parkland, Florida, and offer comfort and support to the community. Details have not yet been finalized.\\nAlso predictably within hours, Democrats, the liberal media, they race as they always do to politicize a tragedy and try to blame, believe it or not, President Trump and Republicans. Let's take a look.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: Step up. Be a man, and talk about it and stop thinking about the NRA and your next campaign donation. Just stop. Everyone knows what you're doing. And it's time.\\nThat does it for us this morning. Stephanie Ruhle picks up the coverage right now.\\nSTEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC: Thanks so much, Mika. Thanks, Joe.\\nAnd to Marco Rubio, you don't have to step up and be a man. Step up and be a human.\\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.: Words of contemplation, talk about mental health are complete not enough. They must be followed by real action. The president has to lead or get out of the way.\\nSEN. BILL NELSON, D-FLA.: The people have got to say enough is enough. We are not continuing with all these massacres. And we have got to have the representatives of the people in the halls of government respond to that.\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\nHANNITY: This has happened with Republican administrations, under Democratic administrations. But what you see there is shameful. It's disgusting. But it's not surprising because it's so predictable. It happens every single time there is a shooting.\\nHollywood celebrities, they are all so quick to post their hateful messages, of course, aimed at the president, Republicans on Twitter.\\nLet's start with Chelsea Handler, tweeting, quote: We have to elect candidates not funded by the NRA in November. We have an opportunity to elect candidates who won't allow kids to go to school and get shot. It's disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing.\\nYou all have blood on your hands.\\nBette Midler: Another school shooting. This in Florida. Congrats to the spineless cowards who do nothing to help us end this horrific epidemic in Congress.\\nAnd Director Adam McKay posted. Normal person, oh my God, kids are being killed in schools, churches, concerts. Let's do something. Republican congressman, kids are being killed in schools and churches and concerts. Let's not do one single thing, #bloodonyourhands @GOP and @NRA.\\nAuthor Stephen King writes: Broward school shooting, there will be prayers from blabbermouth Don, Pence the Grinch and their rightwing cohorts. There will be no call for any sort of sane gun regulations.\\nSadly, it is the left's solution every single time this happens. They rush to judgment. They want to point fingers and blame and use all kinds of vicious horrific, rhetoric. It never accomplishes anything.\\nThey shouldn't be what these tragedies are about here. You have people rolling out the same old tired talking points and political arguments. You know, liberals, they start blaming the weapon that the shooter used. In this case an AR-15. But if they want to ban AR-15s and these mad men, they will use something else. We saw that at Virginia Tech where a gunman used a pistol and killed 32 people.\\nLook, let's get to solutions tonight. I have been in radio for 30 years in my life. This is now my 23rd year at the Fox News Channel. I know all of the talking points. And I know it's all just noise and it's not going to solve the problem.\\nHere's the simple truth. You're not going to change people's minds with a political debate, especially as it relates to the Second Amendment. I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. My mind is not going to be changed.\\nI have thought this through all these years in my life. And I doubt can I change the minds of any of these Hollywood liberals and the anti-Second Amendment crowd. The problem this country is facing right now is school safety.\\nWe can keep repeating the same talking points and talking over each other again and again and again after something like this happens. Or maybe it's trying to actually find a solution to this problem. The children of this country deserve to be protected. They deserve safe schools.\\nAs the president said, no child, no teacher should ever be in danger in an American school. We could all agree on that. No parent should have to fear for their son or daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning.\\nI want to lay out a solution that I think is not political and, frankly, I believe any reasonable person can agree on. This is about the safety and security of students and children in our schools. And every single school in the country immediately a comprehensive, threat assessment done by law enforcement professionals.\\nEvery school has a unique situation. And for those that will say oh, oh, where are we going to get the money for this? Well, I would argue that it's probably more than likely local police, local FBI would be happy to help schools figure out the best plan of action to protect these kids and keep them safe.\\nYou're going to have to secure the perimeter of every school. All points of entry must be secure. You've got make sure that there is a system that controls who is going in and out of the building.\\nAnd in addition to that, you will need a strong, physical security presence. And you can start by hiring trained, armed, former, or retired police officers, trained, armed, former retired armed military veterans.\\nIn other words, let's give our kids the same security that most politicians that they get. Let's give them the same protection that actors and actresses get on the red carpet when they are at the Oscars and pretty much everywhere else they go. We have plenty of retired officers, plenty of trained professionals, plenty of trained military guys. They can conceal their weapons. But their very presence also with the strategy, strategic plan that is properly implemented will bring about a profound change.\\nI know there are probably detractors out there say but, Sean, Parkland, Florida high school, they had an armed security guard.\\nOK, here's the thing. The school has 3,000 students. It's one of the biggest campuses in Florida. You're going to need more than one person to properly assess and deter any potential threat at a facility that large. We need enough people to protect every single building, every point of entry, and the entire perimeter.\\nSome of you will argue, OK, this is going to cost money. You're right. My answer is, yes. But is it not worth every penny so that we never ever have to turn on our TVs like yesterday and see this unfold ever again like what happened in Parkland?\\nHere is another point about the plan. We already know it works. I broadcast from New York City. And post-9/11, you cannot enter a single office building without a work ID. I have a radio building I enter. I have a TV building I enter.\\nIf you are a visitor in any of these buildings, you have to present a valid identification, or else you are not getting in. And have you to be vouched for by people that have been secured and already in the building or work in the building. Every student can have their own valid ID before entering the school and also where needed metal detectors which have already proven to be effective in some schools in the country.\\nHere's the bottom line, we are at a crossroads. It's time to either step up, do our job, create school safety that will work for these kids. Give them the same safety our politicians, actors, actresses, and famous people get. And instead of bringing out the same old talking points and trying to score cheap political points and trying to outdo each other with the same arguments, same attacks, nobody's minds being changed, maybe for once we can solve the problem. And this should be all about solutions.\\nI'm not saying this plan is flawless. Nothing is ever going to stop 100 percent of these things from happening. There is evil in the hearts of other people, unfortunately, in this world. But, why wouldn't we try to do every single thing we can do in this case to prevent these tragedies from occurring and make them less deadly if, in fact, they do happen.\\nHere's a simple test and a question for everybody tonight I think they can ask themselves. If God forbid you ever found yourself in any type of administrative building and that building has an active shooter, would you prefer to know that there are trained, armed, retired military and police already on site to give you a fighting chance? Would you want to know that there was a complete threat assessment, security assessment on that building that was completed? My guess is you probably.\\nHere's our final point. Democrats, they say gun control leads to less violence. Well, if that's the case, I would like for them to explain why cities with the highest murder rates have the strictest gun controls and are run by Democrats. Look at these stats about the number of murders in 2016. All of these cities have Democratic mayors and have been run by liberals for years. Yet, their crackdowns on the Second Amendment, it has done nothing to stop violence.\\nLiberals also don't want you to know about these shocking statistics. During the Obama presidency, over 3,900 murders in his adoptive town of Chicago. And more than 18,000 people who were shot in Chicago just during the last six years of his presidency.\\nDo you remember hearing this kind of outrage and blame by the left about the out-of-control violence? That's one American city. And liberals also love to say that giving people the right to carry doesn't prevent crime. The figures say otherwise.\\nLet's take a look at some of the charts given to us by author 'More Gun Less Crime', John Lott Jr., from the Crime Prevention Research Center. The chart shows violent crime before and after right-to-carry laws were enacted in the U.S., and as you can see having more citizens armed leads to a decrease in violent crime.\\nHere's another graphic on murder rates before and after right-to-carry laws were put into place. Also in the U.S., murders have plunged as a result.\\nAnd as John Lott Jr. points out as more people carry guns you see further drops in both of those statistics.\\nAll right. A lot to absorb. The answer is, we've got to protect our kids. We don't need to tune in to what we saw yesterday ever again. Let's start solving the problem.\\nHere with reaction, the host of JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO.\\nJudge, any court that you walk in to in America I have to go through a metal detector, any one that I have ever been. I also have to present an ID in any court I have ever been to. Every time I have been to Congress, every RNC convention, every DNC convention, every ballgame I go to and every office building in New York.\\nCan we not do something better instead of the same old arguments?\\nJUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE HOST: Well, you know, Sean, you're so right and what you said certainly rang true to me when whenever something like this happens we go to the old argument. The Second Amendment people say, you know, the right of the individual to possess or bear arms shall not be infringed. And then on the left, they say that guns kill people. I think shooters kill people.\\nBut let me start by saying, Sean, number one, that as the D.A., I would often have to tell a parent that their child was the victim of a homicide.\\nSo my heart goes out to all of those parents and all of those people who knew the victims here.\\nBut we need to be very clear. This is not a political issue. This is not an issue about the left and the right and the NRA. Actually, I'm sick of hearing the NRA.\\nAnd in the interest of full disclosure. Let me say I have many guns. I have long guns. I have handguns.\\nBut this is really about the individual and in this case, an individual who not only threatened and posted himself on YouTube as someone who wanted to be a professional school shooter, but that individual had been expelled from school. He had all kinds of personal problems. And, yet, he was able to purchase a gun.\\nWhy was he able to purchase a gun? Because background checks, to be honest with you are a joke in the sense that if you are on cycle tropic drugs, if you have been in a mental institution, HIPAA law protects us and I used to sign pistol permits all the time as a judge. It prevents us, the HIPAA laws from, finding out what your mental history is. So, all the wackadoos from Adam Lanza and school shooters from Aurora, Columbine, they can get them with no problem although some got them from their parents. But that's not the point.\\nYou are absolutely right. We need to protect kids and that means we have got to have metal detectors. We've got to have experienced cops. I don't care if they are retired or they're skilled cops working in the schools. And we've got to be able to have perimeter controls.\\nWe have to have police -- teachers who can carry a weapon and react to this kind of nonsense, because our kids deserve our protection, Sean.\\nHANNITY: You know, look, I'm not saying -- I know schools that right now, if you are a parent, there is only one door you are getting, that they do have security at these schools. There is only one door. And even if they know you, I have gone into schools where hi, Mr. Hannity, I need your ID.\\nFirst thing they would say.\\nPIRRO: Yes.\\nHANNITY: You know, no exception.\\nPIRRO: Sean, you can do that at a building in New York City. They will say hi, Judge Jeanine, do you have your ID? Wait a minute, we're in New York City, you know who I am.\\nBut I agree with you, Sean. What we had here though was a warning that we haven't had in other cases. And with all due respect to the FBI, if they deserve it, based on everything we are hearing, about, I don't want to hear another FBI agent go up to a microphone and say, we had no further identifying information.\\nWait a minute, you are the FBI. Some guy did the right thing and he called you. And he said this kid is on YouTube saying want to be a professional school shooter. How many people in this country have the name Nikolas Cruz? How many people in this country have the name Nikolas with a K. How many have bought a gun.\\nIf we learned anything from 9/11, it's that the federal agencies don't connect with each other. This kid, all the warnings were there. All they needed to do was connect the dots and they didn't.\\nHANNITY: I think, Judge, you couldn't say it any better.\\nAll right. We appreciate your insight. We'll be watching you this weekend and you're in for me tomorrow night and people will be watching. Thanks, Judge.\\nWhen we come back, President Trump, we have a lot of breaking news, vowing tough action on mental health following the shooting massacre in Florida.\\nEd Henry has details and so many more angles and introduce you to the heroes from yesterday, straight ahead.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Talked to my teacher and said I am scared. Then would all heard gunshots. And he unlocked the door and let us in. I had thought he was behind me.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is Mr. Beigel?\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But he wasn't.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened?\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When he opened the door, he had to re-lock it so we could stay safe. And he didn't get the chance to.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: A student describing how her geographer teacher was killed yesterday protecting her and her fellow classmates during the shooting. That's not the only incredible act of heroism we are hearing about tonight.\\nJoining us now with a lot more is Fox News's Trace Gallagher.\\nA lot of heroes here that have come up, Trace.\\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, most schools, including this one have active shooter drills giving students and teachers guidelines on how to react. Experts say during a genuine attack, instinct takes over. And in this case, the instinct of 37-year-old assistant football coach and security guard Aaron Feis was to throw himself in front of students to shield them from the bullets. The coach was shot and later died in surgery.\\nThose who knew him say he died the same way he lived, putting himself second.\\nWatch.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, he was a big man. He sprinted with everything he had towards it to make sure everybody was safe. I heard that he got in front of a couple people and shielded them. He actually took the bullets for them.\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know when Aaron's funeral is, I don't know how many adults are going to go, but you will get 2,000 kids there, the kids in this community loved him. They adored him. He was one of the greatest people I knew.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nGALLAGHER: And witnesses say that geography teacher you mentioned, Sean, Scott Beigel knew that kids in the highway were in danger, so he opened his classroom door to let them in. But when he tried to re-lock the door, the shooter walked by it that very moment and he was shot and killed. Students inside his classroom say he got in the way of the killer and likely saved many lives.\\nSeveral other teachers also barricaded their doors and hid their students.\\nAnd then there was the story of the unnamed janitor who witnesses say helped save the lives of students who were unknowingly running toward the shooter. They say the janitor told them to run the other way and ushered them into a classroom for safety. Listen.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He stopped us and he got us into her classroom. I would say 30 to 40 students into this teacher's classroom at the same time, and as a result of their heroic actions, they saved probably all of our lives, about 40 of us.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nGALLAGHER: Yes, amazing to think -- amazing to think that within seconds many students witnessed both the epitome of evil and the height of heroism.\\nAnd many other stories we have yet to hear about -- Sean.\\nHANNITY: amazing heroism. Thanks, Trace, for that report. We appreciate it.\\nAnd earlier this morning, the president delivered a powerful address to the nation and he says he plans to travel to Parkland, Florida in the coming days.\\nLive from Pompano Beach in Florida with much more, Fox News chief national correspondent, our own Ed Henry -- Ed.\\nED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sean, good to see you.\\nYou want to talk about heroes, I can tell you this time last night at this medical center that I'm standing in front of, there were fears that the death toll of 17 was going to rise. There were still people still in critical condition. People here working around the clock to save lives, doctors, nurses, first responders.\\nI can tell you tonight, there is a glimmer of hope. There is only one patient left in critical condition. They are still rallying around that patient.\\nThe president giving his thanks, certainly today, grateful for everyone, sprinkling into action but also trying to heal the nation as he spoke from the White House. Listen.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nTRUMP: We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation's governors and attorney generals where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. And it's not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHENRY: Now, remember, after that horrific shooting in Las Vegas, the president and first lady Melania Trump didn't just talk to families of victims, they also went in, met with doctors at a medical center, the nurses, the first responders to thank them.\\nI'm told by the doctors here today that without the EMT technicians jumping on this quickly and stopping the bleeding, there would have been many, many more lost lives. And so, the president will be here in south Florida at Mar-a-Lago this time tomorrow night, Sean. There's nothing on the official schedule just yet.\\nBut one official suggested to me that as early as Saturday morning, the president is likely to be at this medical center, the high school, somewhere in this region wanting to show more directly his thanks for everything that everyone on the ground here has done, Sean.\\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Ed Henry, thanks so much for that report. We appreciate it joining us with more. We have former LAPD detective Fox News contributor Mark Fuhrman former FBI special agent Manny Gomez. Mark I have known you over the years. We don't often disagree, you have seen a couple of flaws in what I think -- you are never going to convince an antigun person to be pro-second amendment and similarly I have carried a weapon almost all of my adult life. I have had carry permits in New York, California, Alabama, Georgia and Rhode Island. I have had carry permits. It's part of -- I was trained since I'm 11 in the use of a firearm. So, you are not going to win on that debate. But securing the schools with the professionals to me is 1,000 percent doable. And we owe it to the kids to do this.\\nMARK FUHRMAN, DETECTIVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We do. We do. And the only thing that -- I don't disagree with you. I just think that there is a better approach. When you have retired personnel, they have the best part of their career behind them, and you need a generational gap that isn't two or three generations perhaps the better part of one. These officers on the school need to be able to interact with these students and get that information that a guy like Cruz would have surfaced and they would have actually confided in the officer. You need to get some kind of a system where have you protocols for all these schools so everybody is working off the same sheet of music. And you need to harden the inside targets so the suspect can't get in, and you create the tactical situation for a shooter on the outside, which allows responding officers and the security officers to take out the suspect with no danger to the students. I think this is all possible without gun control.\\nHANNITY: All of it is. Strategically and tactically. Look, my guess, Manny, is you are going to have retired military, retired police or maybe active. I think you can even work in conjunction with local law enforcement to get this done and, again, it would be conceal carry. I think a lot of the students would become friends with these guys over time and Mark is right. We can get a lot of intelligence from them. But strategically, tactically, you surround the perimeter. You have a full threat assessment, security assessment. All -- we know the entry point at any point. And all of this, everybody gets in is known. Nobody that is unknown gets in to that school, period, end of sentence. It seems doable if we choose to do it.\\nMANNY GOMEZ, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: I totally agree. Having the experience of former military, former law enforcement, we just had a wonderful piece where the coach from this high school saved lives. This is a coach that knew these students. He was a father-figure perhaps. Certainly an adult figure to these young men and women. That is what we need. We need people that these young people will respect, look up to if they have problems. Whether it's an active shooter situation or on a more day-to-day basis. A drug condition, a criminal condition, a bullying condition, they will go up to these former law enforcement, former military role models and be able to discuss with them what they could do to help the situation. So it will be a win-win-win on a daily basis.\\nHANNITY: For everybody.\\nGOMEZ: Absolutely right.\\nHANNITY: If they are there every day. Look, I was a kid smoking in the bathroom. I got to know the janitors, everybody because they wouldn't rat me out for when I was young and stupid. But, in all seriousness, they are going to get to know these kids. Those kids are going to open up to them and all the things that the kids are saying post the shooting. This guys would heard it earlier. They have the training and knowledge and how to intervene in a situation like that.\\nGOMEZ: Agreed.\\nFUHRMAN: I agree, Sean. When you have somebody that is inside a system like a school, you have to not only have security, you have to be able to have investigative skills to be able to very effectively and sometimes under the radar investigate some of these problems that you see or that are reported to you. Just remember that all security from the protection of the President to anything that the FBI does, the Israelis, anybody will tell you, security is a layered event. It's not just one. You have layers of security. So you always contemplate a failure of one or something that fails or something that is taken out. You need a layer of security no matter what and a school especially.\\nHANNITY: All right. Thank you both. If every American demands this in their district, we will have safer schools. 1,000 percent safer. All right. When we come back we have a heated debate. Dan Bongino, Geraldo Rivera who is down in Florida as we continue, stay with us.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: All right. Following yesterday's deadly shooting in the Florida. Democrats, members of the media so quick to politicize the tragedy. Take a look.\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\nREP. JIM HIMES, D-CONN.: The pattern will be predictable. There will be a moment of silence. People will wish everybody thoughts and prayers and sympathy for the victims and then the congress of the United States will do absolutely nothing.\\nBRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC: And that city you are in, Washington, if you match it against public opinion polls of their constituents. Lawmakers in that City are failing American people every day.\\nTOM VERNI, CNN: I just really don't know what the body count needs to be before people in Washington, D.C. give a rat's ass about the people in this country and their children.\\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.: This one is the 18th school shooting just this year but also the day-by-day deaths that are preventable and we have an obligation to prevent -- Congress has been complicit. Congress bears responsibility.\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\nHANNITY: All right. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera. Former secret service agent Dan Bongino. Geraldo last night we got a lot of reaction. This has to end. I share your passion and I know how sincere you are, then you went into AR-15 argument.\\nI don't want this to change into a gun debate, because I think we better transcend it quick. I will never convince you that on the issue of guns and I own AR-15's. You are never going to convince me, so, if we get rid of the AR-15, Virginia tech was the worst shooting in history and that was a pistol. Get rid of the AR-15 and get rid of the pistol. What about securing the schools? What about the retired military, trained, armed, police military guys securing the perimeter a real plan like we have for actresses and actors and politicians?\\nGERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEW ROAMING CORRESPONDENT: You know, brother, I totally endorse your campaign to harden our schools. I think that detective Fuhrman laid it out in very explicit terms with the layer defense and so forth and I can't top that. I'm 100 percent behind you on that Sean, but I think that people have to get their arms around a harsh reality. That in the state of Florida and many other states, a psycho, disturbed, expelled 18-year-old who is talking about being the next school yard shooter can legally purchase an AR-15, military style assault weapon. This is a kid who can't buy a beer in this state. I think that it is outrageous and illogical, Sean, and we have to remember one thing that AR-15 was banned. Sales of that weapon were banned in this country from 1994 until 2004.\\nHANNITY: That didn't help.\\nRIVERA: Under the Brady ban.\\nHANNITY: It didn't help.\\nRIVERA: For 10 years we didn't have it.\\nHANNITY: It didn't help.\\nRIVERA: Let us do something. We can't have the kid who is fermenting all this evil inside him have such easy access. Not only did he get the machine --\\nHANNITY: All right, Dan?\\nDAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET AGENT SERVICE: Geraldo, listen, I appreciate your emotional, you know, involvement in this as well. It was a tragedy. But let's talk reality. The assault weapons ban, the Department of Justice's own study on the assault weapons ban said it did almost nothing to reduce firearms violence. So what you are suggesting to be clear here is, what? That legal law abiding American citizens like me, I own an AR, frankly, Geraldo, I like you, I respect your opinion, but I don't care about your opinion about what weapons I should have. Why should I be stopped, because you want to -- hold on, because you wants to reinstitute a ban that the Department of Justice itself said had almost no effect.\\nRIVERA: Have you heard.\\nBONGINO: Wait a second.\\nRIVERA: Hold it, Daniel, have you heard from the children in this school? Have you heard from the children going up to the news teams and telling them how disappointed they are in the adults? Have to do something. Get off the pot. The thoughts and prayers. If I hear one more politician tell me about the dead 17 kids are in their thoughts and prayers, I don't care about their thoughts and prayers anymore.\\nBONGINO: I appreciate that, I get it, I have got kids. You know what? You were a war correspondent at one point. I was a police officer. I have actually been shot at. And do you know what? I had a firearm to defend myself. You know, and suggesting somehow that we are going to make these kids some of whom are dead safer by disarming and making them sheep in a school and by stopping legal law abiding people from getting guns is not the -- entirely disingenuous. Moral high ground on that.\\nRIVERA: Hold on. I have been at Fox News for 17 years. I understand how my feelings on this are not in sync with the majority of my audience. I apologize for that, but you have to know how deeply I feel about this. When an 18-year-old who has been expelled from school whether he is orphaned or leaves his foster family or shooting in the backyard and he is telling other friends you is got to come see my guns, when that kid can go up to this gun seller here and legally purchase an AR-15 with 30 round clips, the standard clips and buy a half a dozen of them, and extra ammo, and this is the same kid, this is the same punk psycho loser kid, who can't buy a Budweiser, because is he underage, if everyone does see how illogical that is, then I feel sorry for people. Your embrace of the second amendment is so fervent and blind.\\nHANNITY: Remember, 32 -- the worse U.S. school shooting, 32 was a pistol. But, let me go back. I think I'm proving a point here. We're not going to convince either side in this debate. You're not going to convince Dan.\\nYou're not going to convince me. We're not going to convince you. I think the answer, I will throw it to Dan first, is to protect the schools. Full security markups of every school. Secure perimeters. Entry point's only and armed retired military police. Dan?\\nBONGINO: Sean, it's the only way. I was a cop. When I used to sit in this cell, sometimes I would talk to the criminals we arrested on gun crimes. America, are you listening to me? Criminals don't care. They don't give a damn about your gun laws. As a matter of fact, they love your gun laws. Do you know why? They get to prey on a bunch of innocent sheep out there. I'm not disputing Geraldo authenticity or his genuine passion for his at all, I am simply suggesting the solution he presents is an irrational one that -- we both agree, Geraldo, this kid should have never been in possession of firearms. I'm simply saying your solution will not work it is entirely irrational.\\nRIVERA: I'm not going to back to guns. I have five kids. I have got a 12-year-old who is in middle school. I want her protected the way my money is protected in the bank. I want her protected the way we are when we go into airports. I want our most -- we always say what your most precious possession? My most precious possession are my children. We always say that let's put our money where our mouths are. I hope that the President as he is coming down and I know that he is coming here to Parkland, will also voice his concerns about this in a very deep and heart-felt way in a sincere way. I agree. But I definitely think we have got to look.\\nHANNITY: Geraldo, at the end of the day, we all agree on that point. And you can't tell me that if we can secure the airport, secure our planes, secure the Oscar's red carpet and everybody else that wants security, that we can't do it for our kids. That is a must. Good to see you both. Appreciate it. If you are a parent, you definitely want to see this next segment. We're going to tell you the warning signs to look for and others if you see it happening, see something, say something that actually happened this time. What should you be looking for, next?\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: All right. Like so many other horrific mass shootings, Nikolas Cruz displayed pretty disturbing warning signs to classmates and teachers including some behavior so bad he was expelled from school. Joining us is psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Bober is with us. And also radio talk show host Dr. Gina Loudon. Dr. Loudon, we got into this last night, all the signs were there. People.\\nGINA LOUDON, RADIO TALKSHOW HOST: They were.\\nHANNITY: People, you know, see something, say something. They said something. The FBI was brought in. The evidence was all over social media. The kids had an inkling that something was very wrong with this young man.\\nLOUDON: Sean, I have been on the ground enough here I have spoken with a lot of the students I spoke with my own children who go to school not too far from here. The thing they are saying yes they want something done as Geraldo said in the last segment, but I think we have to really think about what we can do. Taking politics maybe off the table and really honing in on what is practical to prevent the next shooting. And I would submit to you that it doesn't have anything to do with the things we are talking about. It has to do with the Marshall -- I'm sorry, the military like you are talking about. Coming, being available in the schools. Retired military, Sean. And maybe we can.\\nHANNITY: I'm not talking about military garb.\\nLOUDON: Take politics away. Take politics out of it do what we agree on, right? Let's find solutions for these students and then let's deal with the guns and mental health and all the other stuff on the table.\\nHANNITY: Doctor, let me go to you. I heard from everybody there is going to be a lot of grief counseling. But when you have got a kid that you have got to throw out of school, because he has ammunition in his backpack, it would seem in everybody's best interest, and I know some colleges offer this and maybe they have more of the resources to be able to do it, but it seems that schools should be able to intervene in a way to offer the mental health as soon as you see these signs.\\nDANIEL BOBER, PSYCHIATRIST: Sean, you know what? You know, a lot of people talk about mental illness, they talk about guns, you know, this was the perfect storm that came together. Only 4 percent of firearm homicides are committed by people with mental illness. Mental illness is really not a risk factor for violence. The people who are mentally ill are much less risky than they tend to be more the victims than the perpetrators. And as far as guns, we know that most people with guns are not violent people.\\nBut if someone is hell bent on doing destruction and hurting a lot of people it's going to happen. So there is very little that we can do to prevent these types of instances.\\nHANNITY: I disagree in this sense and I will throw this to Dr. Loudon in the sense that we saw every sign and symptom, social media footprint. What the kids knew about him. Getting expelled from school.\\nLOUDON: So maybe we take.\\nBOBER: Hindsight biased.\\nLOUDON: Maybe we take what we know about this particular instance and we look for that perfect storm and those signals and we put that child in some sort of counseling. But I think that we have to consider that, Sean, 70 percent of Americans are diagnosable by the DSM5 today with some sort of mental issue. Are we going to revoke the right of the second amendment rights of all 70 percent of Americans? That would be a problem. Military rates even higher.\\nHANNITY: We got to pay attention to the symptoms. Thank you both. We appreciate your insight and you being back with us. We have more Hannity right after this.\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\nHANNITY: The race to politicize such tragedy, it's not new. We have heard all the arguments, this time it is time, we can protect all these students if we truly want to and there are people ready, willing and able to do so.\\nAll right. We will have more on this tomorrow night. Thank you so much for being with us. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left for being with us. The show will always be fair and balanced. We are not the destroy-Trump media. We also hope you set your DVR, you will never miss an episode.\\nCopy: Content and Programming C\""

       "'SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Breaking right now, President Trump has read the classified memo showing stunning FISA abuses against his campaign. It will likely be released as early as tomorrow. Also tonight, \"The Hill\\'s\" John Solomon reporting that Republicans are now looking to make the case that the so-called Russia investigation was based on, quote politically tainted evidence tied to Clinton loyalist. We\\'ll explain. And meanwhile tonight, an all-out war on what is the truth and transparency is being waged right here in the United States of America. Fierce, unfair, opposition mounting, what? To conceal and cover up one of the biggest scandals in the history of this country. Now, Democrats led by future MSNBC contributor, Congressman Adam Schiff, they are desperately trying to block the memo from going public by lying and playing cheap partisan politics and we have the evidence. And tonight, Sara Carter is reporting that the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and the DOJ want all names redacted in the classified document and the media is proving just how abusively biased, agenda-driven and corrupt they really are -- and that is tonight\\'s breaking news opening monologue.  All right. Breaking right now, truth and transparency are under assault in our country. Democrats, the liberal media, they are now peddling their lies and conspiracy theories about President Trump with impunity. Now, it has now reached the point where they want to hurt the president so badly that they are now turning on we, the people, the American people and they refuse to pursue what is truth, with all the evidence that they can muster. Now, in their panic, they are trying to utterly destroy the people that are exposing the single greatest threat to our constitutional government in our lifetime. Now, here is why. It has been a year of hell for this country. The media has been lying the whole time. They have been pushing propaganda, conspiracy theories about Trump/Russia collusion even though evidence does not exist. It\\'s a fabrication. It\\'s constructed in their liberal media echo chamber and then falsely repeated over and over again. They may even believe their own lies. Now, the media has carried out this lie even though top ranking Democrats and national security officials have all said there\\'s no collusion. In case they forgot, let us do their job and remind them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF, \"THIS WEEK\"/ABC, JUNE 18, 2017.  No evidence, no evidence. They have been focused on perpetuating something they know is a lie. Now, we have been slowly uncovering a massive American scandal that makes Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, look like minor infractions. Now, Fox News is reporting tonight that President Trump has, in fact, reviewed the four page classified memo that exposes massive and severe FISA abuses against members of his campaign and then his incoming Cabinet. And sources are telling us the memo will, in fact, be released tomorrow. As can you imagine, after a year of lies and painting of false narrative, Democrats in the media they are now hyperventilating and breathlessly doing everything they can possibly do to discredit and stop the memo from being released. What are they so afraid of? Let\\'s start with the MSNBC conspiracy host in training, Congressman Adam Schiff. He went running to all his liberal allies in the media like Paul Revere claiming that the memo sent to the White House had been, quote, secretly altered and, quote, material changes were made. Now, in Schiff\\'s twisted mind, this means that the memo wouldn\\'t be able to be released to the public because House rules were violated. And the media goes into full hyperventilation mode and they were ecstatic and they were all wrong. We will explain that in just a second. But, first, just take a look at what\\'s happening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) LAWRENCE O\\'  See the echo chamber? You got the liberal congressman and the liberal media and they echo each other. Wow, big surprise. And they are wrong. Schiff is lying. Our own Catherine Herridge reporting tonight that edits made to the memo were for, A, grammar and, B, clarity and additional edits the ones that were done were requested by the FBI to protect sources and methods and at the request of Democrats, meaning people like Adam Schiff on the House Intelligence Committee. Now, this part is very key and I hope Adam Schiff is listening, because he apparently was rushing to an MSNBC interview when the memo was being updated. All of the edits were made before the memo was sent to the White House for review and not after like Schiff is claiming. Now, in typical Democratic distraction fashion, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, they are all doing their best to disparage the memo and attacking House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. And they\\'re demanding that Nunes be removed from his position. And their liberal colleagues are also attacking the memo. Notice they all sound alike -- one big lying echo chamber. It\\'s amazing. Propaganda. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONN.  Right. The liberal media is following their commands from their Democratic allies because they are one big group together and all they have in the media is an extension of what the Democrats want. They are also trying to slam the memo. Why are they so afraid of the memo? Watch this.  This is something that will haunt this country if we don\\'t fix what has happened which I will be explaining. And even disgraced former FBI Director James Comey, well, is he trying to get in on the action. And tonight, Comey tweeted  Is Hillary above the law? Do we have a dual justice system? Do we have equal justice under the law? Compare that coverage to what we showed you earlier how the media is trying to malign, ridicule a memo, detailing a major FISA abuse against an opposition party during a campaign. This scandal in the end will make Watergate look like a parking ticket. And members of Congress that have seen the memo say it shocks the conscience. Yet the media doesn\\'t want you to see it and seemingly doesn\\'t care as they do the bidding for the Democratic Party like they have done for a year, pushing a false Trump-Russia narrative that has no evidence. Now, the media is now actively working and in concert with the Democratic Party. They are working to prevent you, the American people, from seeing what\\'s in the memo. Let the memo speak for itself and you decide. And all of this proves is that the news media, they don\\'t seem to care about civil liberties. We do have constitutional protections, the Fourth Amendment on reasonable search and seizure, and the media have just become shrills and hacks for the Democratic Party. They are only focused on undermining and destroying President Trump. Whatever they can possibly find or do or make up. Here is another historical comparison. Remember the Pentagon Papers? That exposed how the American government, especially the Lyndon Johnson administration, lied to the public about the country\\'s involvement in Vietnam for decades. Now, The New York Times and The Washington Post at the time, they fought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court for the right to publish those classified documents and guess what? They won. Guess what? The truth was exposed. But now the media is doing the exact opposite. They want the memo kept secret, which is pathetic. They are doing a great disservice to you, the American people. Instead pushing for truth, they are now trying to attack anybody that is trying to expose the biggest case of abuse of power we have ever seen in our lifetime. And people that are trying to be transparent and let you see the truth are under attack by the press and the left that has now aligned themselves. They are one in unison now. There is no separation between left wing liberal politicians and your media. No line of separation. The media is a bunch of willing accomplices and basically propagandists desperately trying to change the narrative. They have been wrong for an entire year. Here\\'s what they won\\'t tell you. This is what this all comes down to. The scandal starts with Hillary Clinton. They don\\'t care if she rigged -- Donna Brazile, head of the DNC, rigged a primary against Bernie Sanders. Imagine if Donald Trump did that and in the Republican primary. Then, corrupt the officials James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew McCabe and probably Loretta Lynch, they put the fix in protecting Hillary Clinton with an exoneration before an investigation even though we know she mishandled and destroyed classified information and broke the law. From there, Clinton took that idea of rigging primaries and then tried to apply it to the general election. Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign and the money she controlled through the DNC, they spent over $12 million for what turned out to be unverified, totally false, a dossier filled with Russian lies to influence and lie to you, the American people. Then, this is where it gets interesting. Then that Clinton bought and paid for dossier was then taken by senior Obama administration FBI officials -- not rank-and-file, we love them -- and used in part, and this is what we will learn tomorrow, to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on members of the opposition party, the Trump campaign. In other words, they politicized and weaponized America\\'s powerful tools of intelligence to spy on an opposition campaign during an election year and shredding the Constitution in the process. How do you people in the media not care about this? And then they used it to spy on an incoming presidential, you know, transition team and then beyond that. How bad is it? We\\'ll talk to Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and FOX News contributor Sara Carter. All right, it all starts with Hillary rigs a primary. Gets exonerated without investigation we know she broke laws 18 USC 793.  OK. Then she pays for Russian propaganda to lie to the American people because we know it\\'s full of lies. Then the lying dossier is used to obtain a FISA warrant. That\\'s what we are learning tomorrow. I can\\'t - - how is this not bigger on a scale on steroids in human growth hormone than Watergate?  Illegal, crime.  Here\\'s my question. If Donald Trump paid for a phony Russian dossier, millions of dollars, to lie to the American people in the campaign. And then dossier is used to get a FISA warrant on Hillary, OK, how would the media and America react to that?  He lied about Nunes today.  OK. You know -- you have more information. We\\'re going to actually -- why don\\'t you explain what you were telling me earlier tonight that\\'s coming?  Did they know it was false? Did they know Hillary paid for it?  Did they know that the information was fed to somebody else?  Christopher Steele, so they basically  -- sourced the same information.  We will learn that tomorrow.  So, the FBI knew that they were telling a court false information, paid for by opposition candidate.  Meaning top echelon, not rank-and-file. We love you guys.  They are on my side. They\\'re writing me every day.  They knew Hillary paid for it, correct?  They knew she paid for it.  Can he do it when it\\'s released and he discovers it for sure?  Why did you give me false propaganda from another campaign?  So, the whole country has been held hostage phony narrative because of a Clinton paid for dossier lie. Is that a fair statement?  Is that a fair statement?  Thank you both. Tomorrow is a big day. We are just getting started. Tonight, Michelle Malkin and Mike Huckabee are next.  We are being told the classified FISA memo will be released tomorrow. Here with reaction, former Arkansas governor, Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee, and the host of \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\", CRTV, a big hit show, Michelle Malkin. I don\\'t ever get to see you and we are related. I mean, this is ridiculous. How are you? So good to see you. MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\"  I\\'m so happy about your daughter as we talked about on radio today. Thank God. She is doing so well, going to college. We are proud of her and proud of you.  OK, following this story.  Donald Trump pays for Russian dossier. That dossier is used to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Hillary.  What would happen?  No, they are one and the same.  But it\\'s never been this bad.  They wanted truth in Watergate to their credit. They wanted -- maybe because it was a Republican. In this case, they want to prevent truth because this is the biggest scandal I think we have seen. Governor Huckabee, you are also a historian. I know you love history. From a historical perspective, compare this to Watergate. Compare a third rate burglary cover-up into opposition phony propaganda research bought and paid for, then being used as a basis for a FISA warrant against a sitting - - well, then candidate, then a sitting president and what havoc it has reeked on this country for a year.  We are going to learn tomorrow that the FISA warrant in part, the foundational argument in part was the phony Clinton, Russian paid for dossier. I mean, it takes my breath away. If it was Trump paying for phony Russian propaganda for Hillary and then that being used as a FISA warrant in part, what would the reaction to this country be now? It would be so vastly different.  It seems when Comey and Strzok and Page who hate Trump and all the names they have called them, McCabe with their insurance policy, have you ever heard of an exoneration being written months before you investigate and interview the key participants in a crime, potential crime?  Weaponizing intelligence  -- as a political weapon.  Well said. I cannot say that any better. What to do we do at this point, Governor, because when you -- especially as it relates to Robert Mueller. Because if you take away all of this, I argue there is no Robert Mueller. There is no Special Counsel. That all of that you can connect to the phony dossier, then to the phony FISA warrant based on lies, paid for lies.  Amen.  We have 20 seconds, Michelle, last word.  It\\'s so good to see you in studio. I\\'m so happy for you and your family. Thank you for being with us.  And, Governor, thank you. Very profound comments. This country is in a crisis that it doesn\\'t know about. It will know more tomorrow. When we come back, Ed Henry has a report from the White House, Jesse Watters, Jessica Tarlov and much more. Stay with us tomorrow night, also a big night. Hope you will join us.  All right, President Trump making big news drawing two separate speeches he gave to Republicans today. Joining us now from the White House with more, Fox News chief national correspondent, Ed Henry. Is tomorrow release the memo day?  I love Twinkies. All right. Thank God, they saved the company. All right, Ed Henry, thanks for being with us. Joining us now reaction. The co-host of The Five, the host of Watters World, his world we live.  Yes, OK. And Fox News Contributor Jessica Tarlov. Look, to me, there is only one story. Let\\'s imagine for a moment, Donald Trump and his campaign pay $12 million, thereabouts for a dossier filled with Russian lies. Russian -- Russian propaganda, misinformation, to lie to the American people to influence the campaign but even worse, then that is used in part to get a FISA warrant on Hillary.  How would you feel how would you feel about that, Jessica, the liberal?  Yes, it is.  Did you read the memo?  This is a tag team. Go ahead.  By the way people in the media were saying that I\\'m advising him on the memo. First of all, you can\\'t advise this president. He is such his own man. You can\\'t tell him not to tweet. He has his own ways.  I\\'m saying it every night, call your congressman, release the memo. Hello. Go ahead.  Let me tell you something. They used it. I know for a fact and we will learn tomorrow.  Keep going.  We will know tomorrow.  Let\\'s assume for a minute but what I said is true.  Let\\'s assume we do know there were salacious lies. Let\\'s say Donald Trump produce as memo that says Hillary Clinton had hookers in her room in a Ritz Hotel in Moscow urinating on her bed. Now, if that was in there, and it was not true, and then it ends up being the basis in part for a FISA warrant against her by used by Trump, you would be pretty pissed off and the media would be apoplectic tonight, true or false.  True?  You know it\\'s not true.  But this is what else we are going to learn. We are going to learn that the FBI, I believe knew that the dossier wasn\\'t true and they did it anyway and they allowed it to be used anyway. Let\\'s say that -- let\\'s say first hypothetical, we will be able to do a real live show tomorrow. Let\\'s say that\\'s true.  OK.  If the FBI knew, did they abuse their power by bringing to a FISA court, yes or no?  To a court?  I have got to run.  It\\'s his world. And you live in it, remember that.  OK. We will make -- we will make an exception for next week. Rush Limbaugh sounding off on the FISA memo. That\\'s next straight ahead.  So earlier today, Rush Limbaugh has some very wise, harsh words for those trying to block the release of the FISA abuse memo, watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSH LIMBAUGH, \"THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW\"  That\\'s great. By the way, when I do radio, microphone is here. How does he do it from so far away? Maybe that\\'s why he is so number one. I don\\'t know. Former Utah Congressman and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton. OK, I think this is what we are going to get tomorrow. This is why they don\\'t want it, because the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier was used in part to get a FISA warrant, it\\'s Russian propaganda, Congressman.  The irony of Hillary paying the Russians -- paying for Russian propaganda in the end. And then that is used to get a warrant to spy on her opposition candidate in an election year, Tom Fitton, you deal with government corruption all the time. Ever deal with anything this big?  You know, at the end of the day, Congressman Chaffetz, that\\'s it. That there would be no Trump, Russia Collusion without all of these events or the fact that if the FBI knew that this was Hillary Clinton paid for propaganda and Comey, as we understand it, wanted to even hire Christopher Steele and pay Christopher Steele. We\\'ll learn more about that, too. And did Rod Rosenstein expand the FISA warrant? And if he did, he is the one that appointed Mueller. It seems so corrupt and incestuous to me at this point how do we possibly make this right?  Felony who are committed, Tom Fitton -- we only had 20 seconds. And Comey, Page, Strzok, McCabe and likely, lynch, gave her a pass so she could stay in the race, true or false?  That\\'s very important point. Tomorrow I\\'m told it was 10 percent of what\\'s coming. That\\'s scary. All right, thank you all for being with us. We will continue to follow the truth and we will also fight for your right to know. Our video of the day, Hannity hotline next.  All right. Democratic California Congresswoman Maxine Waters has had said some pretty crazy things over the last year but last night in her own state of the union rebuttal, she kind of had outdid herself. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.  I don\\'t think she likes the president. Let\\'s remind you of some of the, Congresswoman\\'s, best moments, take a look.  She thinks Russia is out to get her, that was in the news story. \"Hannity\" hotline time.  Tucker doesn\\'t talk to me. If you have anything to say, shout out at us, 877-225-8587. I can\\'t believe -- I\\'m taking ten seconds of my show, Laura Ingraham is next. Ten seconds early, you\\'re not even ready, are you?'"
